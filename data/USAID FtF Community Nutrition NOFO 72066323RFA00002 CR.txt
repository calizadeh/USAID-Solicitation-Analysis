TITLE 
Feed the Future Ethiopia Community Nutrition Activity. 


2. 
INTRODUCTION 
Feed 
the 
Future 
Ethiopia 
Community 
Nutrition 
Activity, 
from 
here 
on 
known 
as 
“Activity” 
is 
designed 
to 
addressthepublicpurposeofimprovingnutritionaloutcomesthroughevidence-based 
and 
theory-grounded 
interventions. 
The 
overall 
goal 
of 
this 
activity 
is 
to 
improve 
the 
nutritional 
status 
of 
women 
and 
children 
through 
improving 
appropriate 
nutritional 
practices 
and 
utilization 
of nutrition services in the communities. 


This 
activity 
will 
focus 
its 
support 
primarily 
at 
community 
level 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
citizens 
can 
effectively 
act 
to 
improve 
their 
nutrition 
status. 
It 
will 
enhance 
USAID’s 
effort 
to 
integrate 
and 
layer 
development 
activities 
within 
certain 
geographic 
areas. 
These 
sectors 
include 
Health, 
Agriculture, 
Food 
Security, 
WASH, 
Education, 
and 
Gender, 
Youth 
and 
Social 
Inclusion 
(GYSI). 
The 
Activity 
will 
have 
a 
hundred 
percent 
geographical 
overlap 
with 
Feed 
the 
Future 
Ethiopia 
Food 
and 
Agriculture 
System 
Transformation 
(FAST) 
Activity, 
which 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
nutrition 
sensitive 
approaches 
while 
this 
activity 
will 
mainly 
focus 
on 
nutrition 
specific 
approaches 
and 
multi 
sectoral-multi 
stakeholder 
coordination. 
In 
addition, 
there 
will 
be 
substantial 
geographical 
overlap 
and 
technical 
linkage 
with 
other 
USAID 
activities 
as 
described 
later 
in 
this 
document. 
The 
Recipient 
is 
expected 
to 
coordinate 
with 
other 
implementing 
partners 
(on 
a 
woreda-by-woreda 
basis) 
from 
othersectors.Coordinationincludessharingofannualwork 
plans,

officials (e.g., woreda and regional administrators). 


The 
Activity 
will 
support 
the 
communities 
and 
health 
sector 
actors 
to 
improve 
appropriate 
nutritional 
practices 
and 
increase 
utilization 
of 
quality 
health 
and 
nutrition 
services, 
with 
an 
overall 
goal 
to 
improve 
nutritional 
status 
of 
women 
and 
children. 
It 
will

OBJECTIVE 
As 
described 
in 
this 
NOFO, 
the 
Activity 
is 
intended 
to 
foster 
appropriate 
nutritional 
practices 
in 
households 
and 
communities 
and 
increase 
demand 
for 
nutrition 
services 
from 
the 
community-based 
health 
facilities 
i.e., 
health 
posts, 
health 
centers 
and 
primary 
hospitals, 
and 
Health 
Extension 
Workers 
(HEWs). 
The 
Activity 
will 
also 
improve 
quality 
of 
services 
delivered 
from 
the 
health 
facilities 
and 
strengthen 
coordinated 
implementation 
of 
nutrition 
intervention 
from 
different 
sectors. 
The 
interventions 
will 
have 
a 
strong 
focus 
on 
the 
first 
thousand 
days 
of 
life, the critical window of opportunity to have greater nutritional impact. 


This 
Activity 
is 
critical 
to 
theachievementofUSAID/Ethiopia’sCDCSDO,asmentionedabove, 
and 
responds 
directly 
to 
Intermediate 
Result 
(IR) 
4.4: 
Utilization 
of 
quality 
health 
and 
nutrition 
services 
increased; 
and 
supports 
IR 
4.5: 
Health 
and 
nutrition 
systems 
strengthened 
for 
greater 
self-reliance. 


Withanoverallobjectiveofimprovingappropriatenutritionalbehaviorandutilizationofnutrition 
services, this activity will have the following specific objectives: 



● 
Improve nutritional practices and demand for services at the community level 
● 
Improve quality of nutrition services at the community level 
● 
Improve capacity for coordination among the nutrition stakeholders across sectors 
The 
Activity 
will 
build 
on 
prior 
USAID 
investments 
in 
Ethiopia, 
such 
as 
Growth 
through 
Nutrition, 
Communication 
for 
Health 
(C4H), 
Transform: 
Primary 
Health 
Care 
(TPHC) 
and 
Transform: 
Health 
in 
Developing 
Regions 
(THDR); 
and 
align 
with 
the 
activities 
under 
Empowered Communities for Better Health (ECBH) project.

BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM STATEMENT 
4.1 
Country Context 
With 
over 
112millionpeople,EthiopiaisAfrica’ssecondmostpopulouscountry. 
DespiteaGross 
Domestic 
Product 
(GDP) 
growth 
of 
8.4% 
percent 
in 
2019 
and 
6.1% 
in 
20201 
during 
the 
Coronavirus 
Disease-19 
(COVID-19) 
pandemic, 
Ethiopia 
still 
ranks 
as 
one 
of 
the 
poorest 
countries, 
with 
a 
per 
capita 
annual 
income 
of 
$8902. 
In 
2020, 
inflation 
reached 
20.6% 
due 
tothe 
pandemic 
and 
other 
economic 
factors. 
Ethiopia 
aims 
to 
reach 
lower-middle-income 
status 
by 
20253; 
however, 
the 
escalation 
of 
conflict 
in 
multiple 
regions 
during 
2021 
is 
having 
significant 
negative 
impacts 
on 
the 
economy. 
Ethiopia 
has 
a 
totalofelevenregionalstatesandtwochartered 
cities, 
Addis 
Ababa 
and 
Dire 
Dawa. 
The 
regions 
were 
formed 
based 
on 
ethnicity 
and 
language 
and 
vary 
widely 
in 
area 
and 
population. 
Based 
on 
the 
2019 
Human 
Development 
Index 
(HDI)4, 
the 
regions 
and 
cities 
in 
Ethiopia 
have 
substantial 
differences, 
and 
Addis 
Ababa 
had 
the 
highest 
score of 0.722 while Afar had the lowest at 0.4285. 


4.2 
Nutrition Context 
Ethiopia 
has 
had 
remarkable 
success 
in 
reducing 
the 
child 
stunting 
rate 
from 
58 
to 
37 
percent 
between2000and2019;however,gainshavebeeninsufficientuntilnowtomeettheglobalWorld 
Health 
Assembly 
(WHA) 
target

Many 
targets 
in 
Ethiopia’s 
second 
National 
Nutrition 
Program 
(NNP-II) 
were 
not 
attained 
as 
planned 
by 
2020. 
The 
2019 
Ethiopia 
Mini 
Demographic 
and 
Health 
Survey 
(EMDHS) 
shows 
a 
37% 
stunting 
rate 
against 
a 
26% 
target; 
59% 
exclusive

rate 
against

and

Substantial 
variation 
in 
nutritional 
status 
exists 
among 
Ethiopia’s 
different 
regions. 
As 
per 
the 
2019 
EMDHS, 
the 
stunting 
rates 
in 
the 
Afar, 
Amhara, 
Benishangul

and 
Tigray 
regions 
remain

the 
highest

rate 
(21.4%) 
followed 
by 
Afar 
(13.5%) 
and 
Gambella 
(13.1%). 
Afar, 
Benishangul-Gumuz, Somali, and Tigray regions have child underweight rate above 30%8. 


Regarding 
women’s 
nutrition, 
the 
2016 
Ethiopian 
Demographic 
and 
Health 
Survey 
(EDHS) 
shows 
that 
22% 
women 
of 
reproductive 
age 
are 
thin 
(Body 
Mass 
Index 
-BMI 
below 
18.5), 
against 
the 
16% 
NNP-II 
target 
by2020.Around29%oftheadolescentgirlsaged15-19werethin 
and 
20% 
were 
anemic9. 
Nutrition 
service 
coverage 
in 
Ethiopia’s 
health 
system 
has 
increased 
in 
recent 
years 
under 
the 
NNP-II; 
however, 
it 
has 
not 
been 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
the 
targets 
and 
varies 
regionally. 
For 
example, 
Growth 
Monitoring 
and 
Promotion 
(GMP) 
coverage 
is 
55% 
against 
an 
80% 
target, 
and 
iron 
supplementation 
during 
pregnancy 
is 
11% 
against 
40% 
respectively. 
Furthermore, 
no 
significant 
programming 
currently 
exists 
to 
address 
adolescent 
nutrition, 
which 
remains a critical gap across the country. 


Nutrition 
interventions 
from 
different 
sectors, 
including 
health, 
were 
seriously 
challenged 
last 
year 
due 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
and 
security 
issues 
stemming 
from 
the 
Northern 
Ethiopia 
conflicts 
in 
the 
Afar, 
Amhara 
and 
Tigray 
regions. 
By 
allaccounts,Ethiopia’snutritionalsituation 
has 
deteriorated. 
Multisectoral 
nutrition 
coordination 
and 
governance 
in 
Ethiopia 
is 
also 
still 
a 
challenge. 
A 
recent 
stakeholder 
consultation 
process10 
showed 
that 
cross-sectoral 
coordination 
and 
collaboration 
engaging 
different 
actors 
are 
weak. 
Subnational 
capacity 
for 
multisectoral 
coordination, 
program 
management, 
and 
data 
use 
for 
decision-making 
are 
poor. 
Serious 
lack 
of 
ownership 
and 
leadership 
prevails 
at 
regional 
to 
woreda 
levels, 
which 
affects 
community-based 
nutrition services. 


For 
the 
Agriculture 
sector, 
progress 
tracking 
under 
NNP-II 
started 
in 
2019, 
and 
most 
indicators 
for 
nutrition-sensitive 
interventions 
showed 
a 
positive 
trend. 
Targets 
for 
fruit 
nursery 
sites, 
household 
poultry 
production, 
and 
nutrition 
corners 
at 
farmer 
training 
centers 
were 
achievedand 
exceeded 
by 
a 
large 
margin 
for 
the 
most 
part. 
Water, 
Sanitation 
and 
Hygiene 
(WASH) 
and 
nutrition 
are 
inextricably 
interlinked; 
therefore, 
WASH 
practices 
have 
significant 
impact 
on 
the 
nutrition 
situation.

showed 
an 
overall

trend 
during 
this

progress 
in

stagnated. 
Between

4.4 
Gender Inequality 
Major 
challenges 
to 
addressing 
nutrition 
in 
Ethiopia 
are 
women’s 
access 
and 
control 
over 
household 
resources, 
time, 
knowledge, 
food 
insecurity, 
and 
traditional 
beliefs 
about 
practice. 
Since 
women 
in 
Ethiopia 
are 
the 
primary 
preparers 
of 
household 
food, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
address 
their 
challenges. 
Global 
evidence 
clearly 
demonstrates 
that 
empowering 
women 
is 
central 
to 
tackling 
malnutrition, 
without 
which 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
nutrition 
programming 
will 
be 
compromised16,17. 


4.5 
Problem Statement 
Despite 
significant 
progress 
in 
the 
past 
two 
decades, 
women, 
children 
and 
adolescent 
girls 
still 
suffer 
from 
high 
rates 
of 
malnutrition, 
especially 
in 
the 
rural 
areas. 
Learning 
from 
the 
previous 
programming, 
national 
surveys 
and 
research 
findings, 
and 
stakeholder 
consultations 
show 
poor 
nutritional 
practices 
at 
the 
household 
level 
and 
low 
utilization 
of 
health 
and 
nutrition 
services. 
This 
is 
largely 
due 
to 
poor 
knowledge 
and 
inadequate 
access 
to 
relevant, 
culturally 
appropriate 
and 
trusted 
information, 
and 
weak 
local 
systems 
to 
innovate 
solutions 
for 
social 
and 
behavior 
change, 
compounded 
by 
gender 
inequality. 
Inaddition,nutritionservicesatthelocallevelarenot 
well 
integrated 
into 
the 
public 
health 
system 
and 
are 
often 
inconsistent 
and 
low 
quality, 
which 
occurs 
because 
health 
care 
facilities 
and 
frontline 
workers 
lack 
the 
resources, 
supplies, 
information, 
and 
know-how 
required 
to 
provide 
quality, 
timely, 
and 
tailored 
services. 
Communities 
depend 
primarilyonthepublichealthsystemfortheservicesduetolackofservices 
from 
private 
or 
NGO 
sectors.Finally,capacityforsustained,effectivemulti-sectoralcoordination 
amongst 
public 
and 
private 
actors 
is 
low 
at 
the 
local, 
regional, 
and 
federal 
levels. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
these 
challenges, 
adoption 
of 
good 
nutritional 
practices 
and 
use 
of 
key 
health 
and 
nutrition 
services among women, children and adolescent girls remain low.

Utilization

Approaches 
to 
improve 
knowledge 
should 
be 
complemented 
with 
information 
on 
accessing

health 
and 
nutrition 
services. 
Individuals 
often 
experience 
difficulty 
understanding 
how 
to 
access 
and 
navigate 
various 
services; 
therefore, 
health 
system 
literacy 
is 
crucial. 
Individuals 
in 
the 
community 
also 
need 
to 
understand 
when 
to 
seek 
services 
from the health system such as knowing the signs of malnutrition or need for ANC or GMP. 


The

Sub-IR 2.4 – Increased NGO and private sector provision of nutrition services 


To 
improve 
access 
to 
community 
services, 
multiple 
service 
outlets 
are 
important. 
Primary 
health 
and 
nutrition 
services 
are 
mainly 
provided 
through 
the 
public 
health 
sector, 
thereby 
creating 
widespread 
dependency 
on 
a 
single 
service 
provider. 
Should 
public 
health 
facilities 
experience 
any 
challenges 
with 
infrastructure, 
human 
resources, 
supply 
chain, 
etc., 
communities 
face 
possible 
service 
disruption 
which 
can 
exacerbate 
their 
health 
needs. 
So 
far, 
the 
availability 
of 
nutrition 
services 
in 
private 
and 
NGO 
facilities 
is 
limited 
and 
not 
well 
supported. 
To 
make 
multiple 
service 
delivery 
points 
available 
to 
the 
people, 
NGOs, 
including 
CBOs/FBOs 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
should 
be 
encouraged 
and 
supported 
to 
be 
engaged 
in 
primary 
healthandnutrition 
service 
provision. 
Availability 
of 
multiple 
service 
delivery 
platforms 
will 
reduce 
burden 
on 
the 
public 
health 
system, 
allowing 
more 
resource 
availability 
for 
poor 
and 
vulnerable 
populations, 
and 
encourage 
healthy 
competition 
in 
improving 
service 
delivery 
quality 
through 
cross 
learning. 
In 
the 
long 
term, 
this 
will 
help 
to 
sustain 
the 
gains 
of 
improving 
community-based 
nutrition 
services. 


This

IR 3 – Improved capacity and coordination among the nutrition stakeholders across sectors 


Addressing 
malnutrition 
requires 
interventions 
from 
different 
sectors, 
which 
firmly 
categorizes 
nutrition 
as 
a 
multisectoral 
issue. 
Having 
adequate 
knowledge 
and 
appropriate 
nutritional 
practices 
depend 
on 
household 
food 
security, 
health 
status 
and 
care-seeking 
behavior, 
WASH, 
education, 
gender 
norms, 
etc. 
To 
achieve 
optimum 
impact 
on 
nutritional 
status, 
these 
relevant 
sectors 
should 
coordinate 
in 
their 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
nutrition-specific 
interventions. 
Also, 
for 
greater 
breadth 
and 
sustainability 
of 
achievements, 
non-governmental 
actors 
including 
academia, 
civil 
society, 
NGOs, 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
can 
have 
significant 
contributions 
in 
nutrition 
advocacy, 
technical 
evidence 
generation, 
capacity 
development, 
and 
program 
management. 


Sub-IR

– 
Improved

and 
sustained 
multisectoral 
coordination at community level 


To 
fully 
support 
multisectoral 
approaches 
to 
improving 
nutrition 
outcomes, 
context-specific 
interventions 
should 
be 
coordinated 
for 
optimal 
cross-sectoral 
collaboration 
in 
activity 
planning, 
implementation 
and 
monitoring. 
This 
activity 
will 
collaborate 
with 
multiple 
sectors 
such 
as 
Agriculture, 
Education, 
Health, 
Livestock, 
and 
Women 
and 
Children 
Affairs 
to 
establish 
and 
strengthen 
coordination 
mechanisms. 
Although 
coordination 
at 
the 
national 
level 
has 
been 
observed with relative success, subnational coordination is typically weak or even absent. 


Therefore, 
this 
activity 
will 
strengthen 
community-level 
coordination 
(woreda 
and

in 
activity 
planning, 
implementation, 
and

for 
communities 
to

overall 
purpose 
of 
the 
Activity 
is 
to 
improve 
nutritional 
status 
of 
women 
and 
children 
by 
improving 
appropriate 
nutritional 
practices 
and 
increasing 
utilization 
of 
nutrition 
services 
at 
the 
community level. To achieve this purpose, interventions under this award should: 


● 
Align 
with 
National 
Health 
Strategy 
and 
objectives, 
mainly 
at 
woreda, 
kebele 
and 
community 
levels: 
coordinate 
with 
the 
HSTP-II, 
HEP 
optimizationroadmap,healthsector 
social 
accountability 
implementation 
strategy 
and 
other 
relevant 
CSO 
and 
local 
government plans and priorities. 
● 
Maximize 
efficiencies: 
Seek 
efficient 
means 
to 
achieve 
desired 
outcomes, 
minimizing 
costs, efforts and ensure sustainability. 
● 
Engage 
youth 
as 
drivers 
of 
change: 
Supportyouthtocreatelocalinnovativesolutionsand 
ensure sustainability 
● 
Build 
on 
past 
investments 
and 
promote 
evidence-based 
practices 
adapted 
to 
Ethiopia: 
build 
on 
the 
successes 
and 
achievements 
of 
different 
activities 
focusing 
on 
the 
local 
capacity 
building 
and 
community 
engagement, 
the 
knowledge 
and 
evidence 
generated, 
and their materials and tools developed. 


● 
Coordinate 
and 
collaborate 
with 
and 
leverage 
the 
activities 
of 
other 
implementing 
partners, 
CSO, 
community 
platforms 
and 
donors: 
Committoworkingwithadiverserange 
of donors, community platforms, CSOs, and partners in health. 
● 
Avoid 
duplication 
of 
efforts: 
All 
activities 
should 
not 
duplicate 
or 
overlap 
with 
the 
investments 
of 
other 
USAID 
partners, 
other 
donors, 
or 
other 
stakeholders. 
All 
activities 
should 
engage 
in 
effective 
coordination 
and 
collaboration 
to 
ensure 
that 
this 
does 
not 
happen. 
● 
Work 
closely 
with 
other 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
donors: 
This 
includes 
the 
Bill 
and 
Melinda 
Gates 
Foundation, 
The 
World 
Bank, 
European 
Union, 
UNICEF, 
WFP, 
FAO, 
WHO and others. 
● 
Promote 
private 
sector 
engagement: 
In 
accordance 
withUSAID/Ethiopia’sPrivateSector 
EngagementStrategy,allactivitieswillmakeconcertedeffortstoengagetheprivatesector 
to 
promote 
better 
development 
outcomes 
and 
to 
increase 
impact, 
reach, 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness of interventions. 
● 
Address 
gender 
inequities: 
Gender 
inequities 
influence 
many 
health 
and 
development 
outcomes 
in 
Ethiopia. 
Hence, 
the 
design, 
implementation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
all 
interventions should be considered through a gender lens. 

● 
Support 
community 
self-reliance: 
Engaging 
community 
members 
as 
change 
agents 
will 
improve 
and 
utilize 
citizen 
capacity 
to 
improve 
sustainable, 
community-led, 
and 
multisectoral solutions in health. 
● 
Design 
disability 
inclusive: 
To 
the 
extent 
possible, 
all 
activities 
should 
develop 
and 
test 
tools 
and 
approaches 
that 
engage 
the 
disabled 
and 
impaired 
individuals 
at 
all 
stages 
of 
activity cycles. 
● 
Be 
client-centered: 
All 
activities 
should 
be 
focused 
on 
impacts 
to 
beneficiaries 
with 
particular stress on women and girls. 
6.2 
Gender and Inclusivity 
Promoting 
gender 
equality 
and 
advancing 
the 
status 
of 
women 
and 
girls 
is 
vital 
to 
achieving 
USAID’s 
development 
objectives. 
It 
is 
USAID 
policy 
that 
the 
Recipient 
must 
mainstream 
and 
integrate 
gender 
into 
their 
interventions. 
Therefore,theRecipientwillbeexpectedtodemonstrate 
compliance 
with 
USAID 
Policy 
Automated 
Directive 
System 
(ADS) 
205 
and 
should 
explicitly 
state 
how 
this 
Activity 
supports 
the 
gender 
policies 
and 
strategies 
of 
the 
United 
States 
and 
the 
Government of Ethiopia. This may include some of the following approaches: 


● 
Key 
personnel 
and 
the 
overall 
staffing 
pattern, 
including 
short-term 
technical 
assistance 
(STTA), 
to 
be 
gender-balanced 
with 
special 
emphasis 
on 
senior 
leadership 
and 
management positions. 
● 
Recipients 
should 
include 
in 
their 
scope, 
activities 
to 
help 
with 
the 
development 
or 
implementation 
of 
safe 
workplace 
policies 
and 
practices 
to 
ensure 
workplaces 
are 
free 
from discrimination and harassment and with a means of redress to enforce these. 
● 
Where 
appropriate, 
gender 
considerations 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
Activity 
to 
ensure 
quality, demand, and access of support to both men and women. 
The 
2019 
Gender 
Analysis 
for 
the 
ECBH 
and 
HSS 
Projects 
identified 
that 
poor 
quality 
services 
influence 
the 
choices 
of 
health 
facilities 
and 
utilization 
of 
health 
services 
by 
both 
men 
and 
women. 
The 
analysis 
indicated 
poor 
quality 
of 
health 
services 
including 
maternal 
health 
and 
Gender-Based 
Violence 
(GBV) 
response. 
For 
example, 
obstetric 
violence 
including 
physical 
abuse, 
neglect, 
non-consented 
care, 
non-dignified 
care, 
or 
non-confidential 
care 
continue 
to 
be 
reported 
in 
Ethiopian 
health 
facilities. 
Moreover, 
there 
is 
no 
clear 
approach 
stipulating 
how 
gender 
parity 
for 
health 
workers 
can 
be 
achieved 
across 
different 
professions 
and 
layers 
of 
seniority. 
Generally, 
HEWs, 
midwives 
andnursingprofessionalsarepredominantlyfemale,while 
female 
health 
workers 
account 
for 
a 
lower 
proportion 
of 
medical 
graduates 
including 
specialists/subspecialists. 


Poor 
service 
quality 
at 
primary 
health 
care 
levels 
has 
caused 
men 
and 
women 
to 
bypassservices 
at 
the 
nearest 
health 
facility. 
For 
example, 
the 
analysis 
findings 
reported 
that 
46 
percent 
of 
individuals 
who 
used 
inpatient 
services 
bypassed 
the 
nearest 
inpatient 
health 
facility 
to 
their 
homes to seek health care at another health facility. 


● 
The 
Activity 
will 
conduct 
a 
more 
in-depth 
gender 
analysis 
within 
the 
first 
six 
months 
after 
award 
to 
jointly 
design 
interventions 
with 
health 
care 
providers 
and 
managers 
(and 
with 
community 
input) 
that 
can 
be 
piloted, 
testedanddisseminatedforreplicabilityacrosstargeted 

health 
facilities. 
Through 
the 
analysis 
findings, 
the 
Activity 
will 
work 
collaboratively 
to 
address and monitor progress regarding gender in the following areas: 


o 
Male engagement in improving nutritional practices. 
o 
Women and girls to access PHC services. 
o 
Community 
engagement 
and 
redefining 
norms, 
e.g., 
decision 
making, 
health-seeking 
behavior. 
o 
Health workforce, including facility management. 
● 
Specific 
gender 
related 
challenges 
in 
the 
different 
FTF 
ZOI 
clusters 
should 
be 
considered 
in 
designing the activity interventions. 
● 
Recipients 
are 
required 
to 
incorporate 
specific 
gender 
indicators 
other 
thansexdisaggregated 
data and monitor their performance on gender.

Youth 
Adolescents 
and 
young 
people 
are 
an 
important 
group 
of 
the 
population 
in 
nutrition 
and 
development 
programming. 
Ethiopia’s 
population 
age 
structure 
showsone-third(33.3%)is10-24 
years

and 
limited 
access 
to 
and 
low 
utilization 
of

health 
services 
by 
this 
group is among the key public health challenges in the country. 


USAID/Ethiopia’s

activities 
have 
been 
supporting 
interventions 
to 
ensure 
access 
to 
comprehensive 
health 
information,

6.5 
Transparency and Accountability 
The 
Activity 
has 
accountability 
as 
the 
core 
element 
of 
the 
second 
result 
area 
where 
horizontal 
accountability 
for 
provision 
of 
quality 
nutrition 
services 
within 
health 
facilities 
and 
through 
HEWs 
are 
prioritized. 
The 
Activity 
will 
support 
accountability 
systems, 
management 
skills 
and 
processes 
in 
the 
districts 
it 
supports 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
self-sustaining 
evidence-based 
quality 
improvement 
culture 
is 
institutionalized. 
This 
would 
include 
improved 
availability 
of 
real 
time 
data 
for 
decision 
making 
not 
only 
on 
coverage 
of 
the 
services 
but 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
standard contents of each service package.

7.3 
Local Capacity Development (LCD) and New Partnership Initiative (NPI) 
USAID 
promotes 
local 
leadership, 
seeks 
bold, 
creative, 
and 
innovative 
approaches 
to 
fostering 
sustainability; 
and 
identifies 
new 
funding 
sources 
to 
sustain 
partnerships 
and 
scale 
impact. 
Locally 
led 
development 
is 
the 
process 
in 
which 
local 
actors 
set 
their 
own 
agendas, 
develop 



solutions, 
and 
bring 
the 
capacity, 
leadership, 
and 
resources 
to 
make 
those 
solutions 
a 
reality. 
Strengthening 
capacity 
through 
organizational 
and 
technical 
assistance 
is 
a 
critical 
component 
to 
strengthening 
local 
systems 
and 
improving 
health 
outcomes. 
USAID’s 
LCD 
guide 
and 
past 
initiatives 
document 
numerous 
examples 
of 
prioritizing 
LCD 
interventions 
and 
technical 
support 
models27 
. 
Hence, 
this 
activity 
prioritizes 
and 
uses 
LCD 
as 
an 
approach 
to 
improve 
localcapacity 
and promote local leadership. 


The 
overarching 
goal 
of 
the 
NPI 
is 
to 
empower 
new 
and 
underutilized 
partners, 
many 
of 
which 
are 
local 
and 
locally 
established 
organizations, 
to 
solve 
problems 
not 
adequately 
addressed 
by 
other 
USAID 
investments 
and 
that 
directly 
respond 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
health 
sector. 
As 
an 
initiative, 
the 
Agency-wide 
NPI 
will 
increase 
USAID’s 
programmatic 
impacts, 
based 
on 
more 
collaborative and adaptive partnering, and improve measurable outcomes at the country level. 


7.4 
Private Sector Engagement (PSE) 
Strategic 
and 
proactive 
PSE 
improves 
the 
identification 
and 
definition 
of 
critical 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
problems; 
strengthens 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
promising 
solutions 
to 
those 
problems; 
and 
increases 
the 
sustainable 
impact 
of 
investments 
at 
community 
level. 
The 
Activity 
will 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
increase 
their 
contribution 
in 
improving 
nutritional 
practices 
and 
provision 
of 
nutrition 
and 
relevant 
health 
services. 
It 
will 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
business 
entities 
alreadyworkinginthehealthsectoraswellasworktowardsmobilizing 
new partners for service delivery. 


7.5 
Local Ownership and Sustainability 
The 
Activity 
aims 
to 
support 
improving 
nutritional 
practices 
at 
the 
communities 
and 
increasing 
utilization 
of 
nutrition 
services. 
To 
ensure 
sustainability 
and 
ownership 
of 
approaches 
and 
tools, 
in 
addition 
to 
strengthening 
public 
health 
services 
at 
the 
community 
level,theActivitywillbuild 
capacity 
of 
communities, 
NGOs 
(including 
CSOs, 
CBOs 
and 
FBOs), 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
Activity 
is 
aligned 
with 
the 
GOE’s 
multisectoralFoodandNutritionPolicyanditsNationalFood 
and 
Nutrition 
Strategy. 
On 
the 
ground, 
the 
Activity 
will 
remainalignedwiththeMOH’sHSTPII

priorities. 
To 
ensure 
local 
ownership 
and 
in 
line 
with 
USAID’s 
NPI, 
local 
and 
indigenous 
organizations 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
Activity, 
including 
as 
subrecipients 
during 
which 
their 
institutional 
and

professional 
associations,public 
and 
private 
higher 
education 
institutions, 
and 
in-service 
training 
centers. 
In

LEARNING 
MONITORING 
AND 
EVALUATION 
(LME) 
AND 
COLLABORATING, 
LEARNING AND ADAPTING (CLA) 
8.1 
LME and CLA Considerations 
USAID 
has 
integrated 
Collaborating, 
Learning 
and 
Adapting 
(CLA) 
into 
all 
aspects 
of 
its 
operations 
and 
programming 
to 
achieve 
better 
development 
outcomes. 
This 
involves 
strategic 
collaboration, systematic and continuous learning, and adaptive management. CLA asks: 


● 
Do you take the time to think critically about your work? (Learning) 
● 
Are you strategic in who you collaborate with, what you’re learning? and (Collaborating) 
● 
Do you use those learnings to change accordingly? (Adapting) 
USAID 
expects 
the 
Recipient 
to 
have 
a 
robust 
LME 
Plan 
that 
is 
fit-for-purpose 
to 
enable 
evidence-driven 
adaptation 
by 
both 
the 
Recipient 
and 
USAID. 
The 
LME 
Plan 
outlines 
the 
approaches 
and 
resources 
for 
learning 
opportunities 
for 
adaptation, 
measuring 
results 
and 
achievements 
of 
activity, 
collaborating, 
and 
adapting. 
Traditional 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
(M&E) 
approaches 
including 
indicator 
monitoring 
are 
included 
under 
the 
LME 
umbrella, 
specifically 
the 
learning 
section. 
The 
Recipient 
is 
also 
encouraged 
to 
apply 
other 
complexity-aware 
monitoring 
and 
learning 
approaches 
such 
as 
outcome 
harvesting, 
most 
significant change, etc. 


The

component 
of 
the 
Activity 
to 
enhance 
effective

Community Nutrition Activity Learning Questions: 

● 
Is 
there 
any 
interaction 
between 
either 
health 
literacy 
or 
SBC 
interventions 
and 
community 
engagement? 
How 
can 
programs 
best 
harness 
individual 
and 
community 
health 
knowledge 
and 
behavior 
for 
the 
broadest 
community 
benefit? 
(ECBH 
Project 
learning question) 
● 
How 
do 
community 
platforms 
linkwithSBCchannelstodevelopconsensusonsocialand 
gender 
norms 
affecting 
health 
and 
nutrition 
outcomes? 
How 
can 
this 
be 
improved? 
Are 
there 
different 
approaches 
to 
link 
to 
SBC 
channels? 
What 
are 
we 
learning 
about 
the 
effectivenessoftheseapproachesinimprovingdemandforservicesandachievingpositive 
behavior change through monitoring mechanisms? (ECBH Project learning question) 
● 
Does 
the 
presence 
of 
community 
platforms 
increase 
accountability 
and 
responsiveness 
of 
local 
primary 
health 
care 
facilities? 
Do 
community 
platforms 
contribute 
to 
improved 
service 
quality, 
and 
if 
so, 
how? 
How 
does 
the 
community

engagement 
contribute 
to 
service 
utilization 
and 
health 
and 
nutrition 
outcomes? 
(ECBH 
Project 
learning question) 
● 
Does 
quality 
improvement 
at 
the 
PHCU 
level 
increase 
utilization 
of 
nutrition 
services? 
How 
effective 
is 
it

Estimate of Funds Available and Number of Awards Contemplated 
USAID 
intends 
to 
award 
one 
(1) 
or 
more 
cooperative 
agreement(s) 
based 
on 
a 
competitive 
basis 
pursuant 
to 
this 
NOFO. 
Subject 
to 
the 
availability 
of 
funds 
and 
at 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
Agency, 
USAID 
intends 
to 
provide 
approximately 
$69.5 
million 
in 
total 
USAID

of 
the 
total 
estimated 
amount 
(TEA) 
of 
$69.5 
million, 
$54.5 
million 
will 
be 
drawn 
from 
Nutrition 
and 
MCH 
funds. 
This 
amount 
includes 
$1 
million 
for 
Crisis 
Modifiers. 
The 
remaining 
$15

Expected Performance Indicators, Targets, Baseline Data, and Data Collection 
Please refer to Section A - Program Description. 


3. 
Start Date and Period of Performance for Federal Awards 
The anticipated period of performance is five (5) years. The estimated start date will be May 1, 
2023. 


4. 
Substantial Involvement 
A 
Cooperative 
Agreement 
implies 
a 
level 
of 
“substantial 
involvement” 
by 
USAID 
(see 
ADS 
303.3.11). 
This 
substantial 
involvement 
will 
be 
through 
the 
Agreement 
Officer, 
except 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
Agreement 
Officer 
delegates 
authority 
to 
the 
Agreement 
Officer’s 
Representative 
(AOR) 
in 
writing. 
The 
intended 
purpose 
of 
the 
substantial 
involvement 
during 
the 
award 
is 
to 
assist 
the 
Recipient 
in 
achieving 
the 
stated 
objectives 
of 
the 
agreement. 
The 
anticipated 
substantial 
involvement 
elements 
for 
this 
award 
are 
listed 
below 
(this 
list 
does 
not 
include 
approvals 
required 
by 
Standard 
MandatoryProvisionsforNon-USNGOsorotherapplicablelaw, 
regulation or provision): 


4.1 
Approval 
of 
the 
Recipient's 
Implementation 
Plans, 
includingbutnotlimitedto,annual 
work 
plans, 
life-of-project 
exit 
strategy, 
and 
any 
subsequent 
revisions 
of 
such 
plans. 
If 
at 
the 
time 
of 
award,theprogramdescriptiondoesnotestablishatimelineinsufficientdetail 
for 
the 
planned 
achievement 
of 
milestones 
or 
outputs, 
USAID 
may 
delay 
approval 
of 
the 

Recipient’s 
implementation 
plans 
for 
a 
later 
date. 
USAID 
must 
not 
require 
approval 
of 
implementation 
plans 
more 
often 
than 
annually. 
If 
the 
AO 
has 
delegated 
authority 
to 
the 
AOR 
to 
approve 
implementation 
plans, 
the 
AOR 
must 
review 
the 
agreement’s 
terms 
and 
conditions 
to 
ensure 
that 
changes 
to 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions 
are 
not 
inadvertently 
approved by the AOR. 


4.2 
Approval 
of 
Specified 
Key 
Personnel: 
USAID 
may 
designate 
as 
key 
personnel 
only 
those 
positions 
that 
are 
essential 
to 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
Recipient’s 
program. 
USAID’s 
policy 
limits 
this 
to 
a 
reasonable 
number 
of 
positions, 
generally 
no 
more 
than 
five 
positions 
or 
five

the 
applicant 
has 
a 
current 
NICRA, 
submit 
your 
approved 
NICRA 
and

than 
USAID, 
provide 
the 
contact 
information 
for 
the 
approving 
Agency.

may 
be 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
award 
subject 
to 
audit 
and 
finalization. 
See 
USAID’s

double 
charged 
or 
inconsistently 
charged 
as 
both. 
If 
chosen, 
this 
methodology 
once 
elected 
must 
be 
used 
consistently 
for 
all 
Federal 
awards 
until 
such 
time 
as 
a

USAID 
policies 
and 
procedures 
related 
to 
environmental 
compliance 
ADS 
Chapter 
204, 
USAID/Ethiopia 
Health 
Office 
developed 
an 
umbrella 
Initial 
Environmental 
Examination 
(IEE) 
covering 
all 
activities, 
including 
this 
Activity, 
under 
improved 
essential 
service 
delivery 
(DO4). 
The 
DO4 
IEE 
was 
amended 
to 
extend 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
IEE31 
till 
10/30/2025. 
A

“Multi-sectoral 
Nutrition 
Award” 
as 
there 
are 
no 
potential 
adverseenvironmentalandsocial 
impacts. 
However, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
implementation, 
the 
Recipient 
will 
monitor 
and 
check 
any 
potential 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts 
that 
may 
emerge. 
In 
tandem 
with 
the 
ECBH 
IEE, 
a 
climate 
risk 
assessment 
has 
been 
prepared 
for 
all 
activities 
under 
the 
ECBH 
project, 
which 
has 
given 
a 
“Low" 
climate 
risk 
for 
this 
activity. 
Accordingly, 
no 
further 
climate 
risk 
management 
is 
required for it. 


The 
Recipient, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
USAID 
AOR 
and 
Mission 
Environmental 
Officer 
shall 
review 
all 
ongoing 
and 
planned 
activities 
under 
this 
award 
to 
determine 
if 
they 
are 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
approved 
Regulation 
216 
environmental 
documentation. 
If 
the 
Recipient 
plans 
any 
new 
activities 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
approved 
Regulation216environmentaldocumentation,it 
shall 
prepare 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
documentation 
for

undertaken 
prior 
to

Any 
ongoing 
activities 
found 
to 
be 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
approved 
Regulation 
216 
environmental 
documentation 
shall 
be 
halted 
until 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
documentation 
is 
submitted and written approval is received from USAID. 


If 
provision 
for 
sub-grants 
is 
included 
under 
this 
award; 
the 
Recipient 
will 
be 
required 
to 
use

to

and 
to 
specify 
monitoring 
and 
reporting. 
Use 
of 
the 
ERForERchecklistiscalledforwhenthenatureofthegrantproposals 
to

funded 
is 
not 
well 
enough 
known 
to 
make 
an 
informed 
decision 
about 
their 
potential 
environmental 
impacts, 
yet 
due 
to 
the 
type 
and 
extent 
of 
activities 
to 
be 
funded, 
any 
adverse 
impacts 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
easily 
mitigated. 
Implementation 
of 
sub-grant 
activities 
cannot 
go 
forward 
until 
the 
ERF 
or 
ER 
checklist 
is 
completed 
and

Recipient 
is 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that 
mitigation 
measures 
specified 
by 
the 
ERF 
or

checklist 
process 
are implemented. 


The 
Recipient 
will
