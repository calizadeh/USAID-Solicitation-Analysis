Private Sector Partnerships to Strengthen Higher Education 


A.1 
Purpose 
This 
activity 
aims 
to 
strengthen 
partnerships 
between 
theprivate 
sector 
and 
academic 
institutions, 
and 
support development of market-oriented and experiential learning approaches. 


This 
will 
be 
achieved 
through 
sustained 
collaboration 
between 
the 
private 
sector, 
local 
and 
US-based 
universities 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
making 
higher 
education 
more 
relevant 
and 
responsive 
to 
Kosovo’s 
evolving market needs as a developing democratic country. 


The 
activity 
will 
facilitate 
partnerships 
between 
industry 
and 
universities 
for 
innovation-led 
development. 
The 
activity 
will 
support 
and 
sustain 
an 
ecosystem 
and 
will 
lead 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
partner 
with 
higher 
education 
institutions 
to 
offer 
market-relevant 
programs 
that 
will 
prepare 
the 
next 
generation 
of 
graduates 
with 
the 
practical 
skills 
inthe 
given 
field. 
The 
establishmentof 
networks 
between 
the 
private 
sector, 
U.S. 
and 
local 
higher 
education 
institutions 
will 
build 
capacity 
to 
accelerate 
the 
development 
of 
key 
industry 
sectors 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
with 
high 
potential 
for 
growth. 


The 
activity 
will 
utilize 
opportunities 
to 
build 
on 
successes 
of 
previous 
Higher 
Education 
interventions. 
This 
will 
be 
accomplished 
through 
a 
collaborative 
approach 
working 
with 
key 
stakeholders, 
including 
the 
private 
sector, 
local 
and 
the 
U.S. 
based 
higher 
education 
institutions, 
with 
clear 
shared 
objectives 
and 
shared 
benefits 
to 
all 
sides. 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
activity, 
the 
target 
stakeholders 
include 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
local 
and 
U.S. 
based 
higher 
education 
institutions. 
In 
addition, 
key 
stakeholders 
for 
a 
successful 
implementation 
of 
this 
activity 
will 
include 
diaspora, 
non-profits, and government institutions, e.g., Ministry of Education. 


As 
elaborated 
in 
the 
USAID’s 
Higher 
Education 
Program 
Framework, 
the 
core 
functions 
of 
a 
higher 
education 
system 
are: 
to 
provide 
quality 
and 
relevanteducation 
and 
training;advance 
knowledge 
and 
research; 
and 
engage 
and 
strengthen 
networks 
and 
communities.Higher 
education 
institutions 
(HEIs) 
around 
the 
world 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
skills 
development, 
advancing 
research 
and 
strengthening 
networks 
and 
communities. 
Combined 
with 
the 
agency’s 
Private 
Sector 
Engagement 
Policy, 
a 
market 
based approach can lead to sustainable outcomes. 


A.2 
Theory of Change 
IF 
higher 
academic 
institutions, 
in 
partnership 
with 
the 
private 
sector, 
strengthen 
their 
capacity 
to 
better 
respond 
to 
Kosovo’s 
development 
needs, 
THEN 
the 
enabling 
environment 
for 
the 
youth 
workforce 
will 
improve, 
thus 
contributing 
to 
the 
alignment 
of 
youth 
work 
skills 
to 
market 
needs 
and 
ultimately increasing citizen contribution to democracy and economy.

CONTEXTAND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 


● 
Kosovo is the youngest country in Europe with almost 40% of the population under the age of 
20; 
● 
Kosovo has the highest youth unemployment rate in the region (46%); 
● 
Lack of a skilled workforce is a factor that cripples the private sector; 
● 
and, HEIs are not equipped to deliver the workforce that Kosovo’s developing economy 
needs. 
Kosovo 
is 
the 
country 
with 
the 
youngest 
population 
in 
Europe: 
around 
38 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
is 
younger 
than 
20.1 
The 
country 
struggles 
with 
a 
high 
unemploymentrate 
especially 
among 
youth, 
low 
GDP 
growth, 
and 
a 
high 
trade 
deficit. 
Despite 
a 
positive 
growth 
rate 
of 
around 
4 
percent, 
the 
employment 
rate 
remains 
low 
and 
a 
significant 
gender 
gap 
in 
access 
to 
economic 
opportunities 
persists.2 
This 
is 
further 
exacerbated 
by 
the 
COVID 
19 
pandemic 
restrictions 
that 
are 
affecting 
Kosovo’s 
economy 
and 
education 
sector. 
Another 
challenge 
that 
Kosovo 
faced 
during 
recent 
years 
is 
migration, 
mainly 
for 
economic 
reasons 
and 
jobs, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
better 
education 
opportunities 
which 
includes higher education. 


Despite 
high 
unemployment 
rates, 
companies 
in 
Kosovo 
still 
face 
difficulties 
in 
hiring 
competent 
candidates citing lack of experience and lack of skills in most occupations. 


The 
private 
sector 
can 
lead, 
when 
given 
the 
opportunity, 
in 
tackling 
development 
issues. 
In 
order 
to 
be 
successful, 
this 
activity 
will 
collaborate 
closely 
with 
the 
private 
sector. 
Allowing 
the 
private-sector 
to have an important and sustainable role will enable a more competent workforce. 


HEIs 
are 
overly 
focused 
on 
theory 
and 
lack 
hands-on 
and 
experiential 
learning. 
Opportunities 
for 
meaningful 
private 
sector 
input 
are 
both 
a 
need 
and 
an 
opportunity 
for 
students 
as 
meaningful 
exposure 
to 
practical 
experience 
are 
limited. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
graduates

Private 
Sector 
Partnerships 
toStrengthen 
Higher 
Education 


education 
system 
in 
the 
country 
are 
not 
adequately 
prepared 
for 
entering 
the 
labor 
market, 
and 
for 
engaging 
with 
their 
communities. 
They 
also 
lack 
the 
opportunities 
and 
skills 
that 
drive 
innovation. 
Kosovo’s 
higher 
education 
institutions 
lack 
capacity 
and 
linkages 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
provide 
relevant 
skills, 
a 
capacity 
that 
US 
higher 
education 
institutions 
possess 
and 
could 
provide 
mentorship. 
The 
private 
sector 
needs 
skilled 
graduates. 
Partnerships 
between 
higher 
education 
institutions 
and 
the 
private sector are critical for linking the demand and supply for these skills. 


Many 
studies 
that 
also 
confirm 
the 
importance 
of 
research 
and 
innovation 
as 
one 
of 
the 
key 
factorsin 
the 
sustainable 
development 
of 
a 
country. 
According 
to 
the 
European 
Commission’s 
2020 
Report 
on 
Kosovo3, 
the 
country 
needs 
to 
considerably 
increase 
investments 
in 
research 
and 
innovation 
(currently, 
government 
research 
spending 
amounts 
to 
only 
0.1% 
of 
GDP, 
despite 
a 
0.7% 
target 
mandated 
by 
law) 
and 
seek 
to 
stimulate 
investment 
from 
the 
private 
sector. 
Researchers 
in 
Kosovo, 
both 
professors 
and 
post-graduate 
students, 
lack 
access 
to 
relevant 
international 
academic 
journals 
and 
other 
relevant 
scientific 
sources 
to 
conduct 
quality 
research. 
This 
leads 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
coordination 
between 
research 
needs 
and 
what 
researchers 
can 
offer 
to 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sectors 
and 
society 
in 
general. 


As 
confirmed 
by 
a 
recent 
report 
produced 
by 
the 
USAID 
Compete 
Activity, 
Kosovo 
was 
unable 
to 
develop 
its 
research 
and 
technology 
capacity 
for 
a 
number 
of 
factors 
including 
long 
yearsof 
conflict 
in 
the 
1990s 
that 
created 
gaps 
in 
human 
and 
technical 
capacity 
for 
research 
and 
development 
(R&D), 
and 
thatKosovo’s 
private 
sector, 
dominated 
by 
micro-enterprises, 
was 
unable 
tostep 
in 
to 
fill 
the 
void 
in R&D investment and technology transfer. 


Successful 
implementation 
of 
this 
Activity 
will 
link 
the 
local 
higher 
education 
institutions 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
order 
to 
advance 
Kosovo’s 
workforce 
competitiveness 
and 
long 
term 
economic 
development. 


A.3 
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES 
The 
implementing 
partner 
will 
define 
the 
specific 
relationships 
based 
on 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
partner 
organizations 
from 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
higher 
education 
institutions 
through 
the 
following 
objectives: 


Objective 
1: 
Increased 
universities’ 
analytic 
capabilities 
and 
access 
to 
labor 
market 
data 
in 
partnership with the private and public sector. 


Universities 
will 
collaborate 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
identify 
relevant 
study 
programs 
and 
will 
put 
in 
place 
sustainable 
mechanisms/systems 
that 
will 
keep 
feeding 
universities 
with 
market 
relevant 
data, 
so that they stay up to date with their study program offerings. 


The efforts under this objective will result in: 


-Universities’ data management systems established/strengthened 


-Mechanisms/systems for ongoing market analysis and skills demand projections developed 


-Universities’ linkages with employers and business associations strengthened

The 
activity 
will 
partner 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
catalyze 
effective 
private-sector 
led 
solutions, 
through 
a 
collaborative 
approach. 
This 
is 
a 
sustainable 
approach 
to 
empower 
stakeholder’s 
responsibility 
and 
accountability. 
USAID 
has 
the 
convening 
power 
and 
clout 
with 
a 
trusted 
private 
sector 
network, 
and 
university 
partnership 
network, 
that 
has 
made 
a 
huge 
difference, 
and 
cancreate 
a 
sustainable 
future 
with 
willing 
leadership 
among 
local 
universities. 
Additionally, 
this 
partnership-building 
approach, 
including 
the 
Universal 
Design 
of 
Learning, 
is 
applicable 
to 
the 
majority of the local higher education institutions in the country. 


Inclusive 
Development. 
The 
economic 
gender 
gap 
is 
a 
major 
concern 
for 
Kosovo’s 
democratic 
and 
economic 
development. 
External 
data 
cite 
a 
female 
participation 
rate 
of, 
at 
most, 
30 
percent 
in 
the 
labor 
force. 
Additionally, 
persons 
with 
disabilities 
lack 
adequate 
access 
to 
education 
and 
have 
less 
opportunities 
for 
employment. 
By 
strengthening 
the 
linkages 
between 
private 
sector 
and 
academia 
through 
sustainable 
partnerships, 
the 
activity 
will 
contribute 
to 
substantially 
transforming 
social 
norms 
and 
stereotypes 
related 
to 
gender, 
persons 
with 
disabilities, 
and 
other 
marginalized 
groups 
including 
ethnic 
minorities. 
The 
activity 
will 
integrate 
the 
Universal 
Design 
for 
Learning, 
and 
this 
approach 
will 
also 
strengthen 
the 
capacities 
of 
the 
local 
higher 
education 
institutions 
to 
institutionalize 
inclusive 
education 
practices. 


Coordination. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
private 
sector, 
U.S. 
universities 
and 
local 
higher 
education 
institutions, 
key 
stakeholders 
for 
this 
activity 
will 
include 
diaspora, 
non-profits, 
and 
government 
institutions, 
e.g., 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
advisory 
groups 
like 
the 
Kosovo 
Higher 
Education 
Round 
Table. 
The 
activity 
will 
coordinate 
closely 
with 
the 
new 
Workforce 
Activity 
and 
Compete 
to 
ensure 
complementarity. 
This 
activity 
will 
also 
coordinate 
with 
other 
donors 
in 
the

such 
as 
the 
Austrian

Agency. 
Strong 
U.S. 
university 
presence 
will 
catalyze

will 
ground 
truth 
changes 
in 
the 
operating 
environment 
due 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
including other donor interventions. 


Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning: 


The 
activity 
will 
adopt 
adaptive 
approaches 
to 
achieving 
the 
objectives, 
for 
example 
by 
being 
informed 
through 
ongoing 
contextual 
analyses. 
Further, 
the 
activity 
will 
continually 
assess 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
interventions, 
evaluate 
whether 
those 
interventions 
are 
succeeding, 
apply 
lessons 
learned, 
and 
adapt 
work 
appropriately. 
Significant 
shifts 
within 
the 
country 
context 
may 
require 
the 
adaptation 
of 
approaches 
and 
desired 
results, 
including 
ways 
in 
which 
progress 
is 
assessed. 
The 
activity 
will 
regularly 
and, 
at 
least 
bi-annually, 
assess 
its 
progress 
and 
whether 
assumptions 
continue 
to 
hold, 
keeping 
abreast 
of 
new 
developments 
that 
may 
create 
challenges 
or 
windows 
of 
opportunity. 
Milestones that will indicate the activity is successful will be established on an annual basis. 


The 
activity 
will 
establish 
in 
the 
first 
90 
days 
a 
project 
performance 
monitoring, 
evaluation 
and 
learning 
plan 
(MELP) 
that 
incorporates 
an 
Adaptive 
Management 
approach. 
The 
MELP 
will 
outline 
the 
systematic 
process 
of 
collecting 
and 
analyzing 
performance 
data 
and 
other 
information 
to 
track 
progress 
toward 
planned 
results 
and 
to 
proactively 
learn 
and 
adapt 
for 
future 
interventions. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
MELP 
will 
be 
based 
on 
baseline 
data 
that 
is 
determined 
in 
the 
first 
year, 
and 
it 
will be informed by periodic assessments that track implementation progress.

Registration, 
only 
in 
case 
that 
they 
are 
requested 
to

a 
full 
application 
will 
DUNS 
and 
SAM 
Registration is mandatory. 


USAID

all 
applicable 
unique 
entity 
identifier 
(DUNS 
number) 
and 
System 
for 
Award 
Management 
(SAM) 
requirements. 
Each 
applicant 
(unless 
the 
applicant 
is 
an 
individual 
or

Therefore, 
applicants 
are 
encouraged 
to 
begin 
the 
process 
early. 
If 
an 
applicant 
has 
not 
fully 
complied 
with 
the 
requirements 
above 
by 
the 
time 
USAID 
is 
ready 
to 
make 
an 
award, 
USAID 
may 
determine 
that 
the 
applicant 
is 
not 
qualified 
to 
receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.

access 
to 
non-public 
information 
regarding 
a 
federal
