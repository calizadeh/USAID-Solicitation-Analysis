SECTION A: PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 


I. 
OVERVIEW 
Wildlife 
Trafficking 
is 
the 
fourth 
most 
lucrative 
transnational 
crime 
after 
the 
trafficking 
of 
drugs, 
humans, 
and 
arms.1In 
addition, 
wildlife 
trafficking 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
one 
of 
the 
main 
threats 
to 
biodiversity 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
region, 
threatening 
resilience 
and 
sovereignty 
of 
small 
island 
states. 
Much 
of 
the 
demand 
stems 
from 
Asia. 
Exploitation 
of 
wildlife 
from 
the 
Caribbean 
and 
elsewhere 
not 
only 
undermines 
sustainable 
development 
but 
also 
increases 
risk 
of 
exposure 
to 
zoonoticpathogens 
by 
opening 
accessto 
previously 
untouched 
landscapes 
and 
creating 
unregulated 
global 
wildlife 
trade 
networks. 
As 
international 
investment 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
and 
Latin 
America 
has 
grown, 
so 
haverates 
of 
illegal 
wildlife 
trade 
in 
the 
region. 
A 
program 
improving 
wildlife 
crime 
enforcement, 
including 
strengthening 
related 
legislation, 
is 
needed 
to 
increase 
law 
enforcement, 
security and justice sector capacity to counter transnational crime.2 


Economic 
cooperation 
and 
trade 
between 
Caribbean 
countries 
and 
global 
markets 
in 
recent 
years 
has 
led 
to 
an 
influx 
of 
foreign 
businesses 
and 
migrant 
workers, 
increasing 
demandandcreating 
newtraffickingnetworksforwildlifesuchasjaguarskinsandparts, 
crocodile, 
sharks, 
and 
sea 
turtles, 
among 
other 
species3. 
These 
networks 
seem 
to 
benefit 
from 
weak 
political 
will 
to 
enforce 
or 
implement 
existing 
laws 
and 
plans, 
often 
which 
are 
very 
strong. 
Lack 
of 
transparency, 
corruption, 
and 
competing 
priorities 
are 
contributing 
factors 
to 
these 
challenges 
and 
enable 
networks 
to 
exploit 
already 
struggling 
systems, 
thus 
undermining 
USAID 
investments 
in 
these 
areas. 
The 
role 
that 
domestic 
markets 
and 
local 
actors 
play 
in 
contributing 
to 
the 
illegal 
trade 
of 
wildlife 
as 
pets, 
meat, 
and 
traditional medicines can also not be overlooked. 


USAID 
is 
a 
key 
partner 
in 
the 
U.S. 
government’s 
Interagency 
Task 
Force 
on 
Combating 
Wildlife 
Trafficking 
and 
on 
conservation 
crime 
more 
broadly. 
The 
2013 
Executive 
Order 
on 
Combating 
Wildlife 
Trafficking 
and 
the 
Eliminate, 
Neutralize, 
and 
Disrupt 
Wildlife 
Trafficking 
Act 
of 
2016 
established 
combating 
wildlife 
trafficking 
as 
a 
U.S. 
government 
priority. 
With 
the 
2017 
Executive 
Order 
on 
Transnational 
Organized 
Crime, 
the 
USG 
added 
combating 
conservation 
crimes 
to 
the 
interagency 
effort, 
highlighting 
the 
links 
between 
transnational 
organized 
crime 
and 
illegal 
logging, 
illegal, 
unreported 
and 
unregulated 
(IUU) 
fishing, 
and 
illegal 
extractionand 
trade 
of 
gold, 
in 
addition 
to 
wildlife 
trafficking. 
USAID’s 
efforts 
to 
combat 
wildlife 
trafficking 
also 
aid 
the 
broader 
agency 
framework 
for 
countering 
malign 
influence 
and 
safeguarding 
the 
development 
gains 
of 
partner countries. 


II. 
BACKGROUND 
. 


The 
Caribbean 
region 
consists 
of 
34 
different 
political 
divisions, 
including 
independent 
countries 
and 
dependent 
territories, 
and 
is 
an 
important 
biodiversity 
hotspot 
with 
many 
endemic 
species. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Caribbean 
faces 
a 
number 
of 
environmental 
threats,

including 
environmental 
crimes 
such 
as 
wildlife 
trade, 
the 
illegal 
exploitation 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
illegal 
unreported 
and 
unregulated 
fishing 
(IUU 
fishing). 
The 
trade, 
illegal 
and 
legal 
exploitation 
of 
wildlife 
to 
global 
markets 
is 
mostly 
due 
to 
the 
wealth 
of 
biodiversity 
within 
the 
Caribbean 
region. 
Wildlife 
trafficking 
is 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
biodiversity 
across 
the 
world 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
region. 
The 
World 
Economic 
Forum 
estimates 
that 
illegal 
wildlife 
trafficking 
is 
valuedbetween 
$7 
billion 
and 
$23 
billion 
each 
year, 
making 
it 
the 
fourth 
most 
lucrative 
global 
crime 
after 
drugs, 
humans, 
and 
arms. 
Wildlife 
and 
wildlife 
products 
are 
trafficked 
from 
the 
wider 
Caribbean 
to 
high-demand 
markets 
around 
the 
globe 
where 
they 
are 
sold 
as 
food 
(e.g., 
conch 
meat, 
shark 
fins, 
sea 
cucumbers, 
sea 
turtle 
meat 
and 
eggs, 
and 
spiny 
lobster); 
jewelry 
(e.g., 
corals 
and 
tortoise 
shell); 
souvenirs 
(e.g., 
sea 
turtle 
shells, 
black 
coral, 
and 
starfish); 
pets 
(e.g., 
ornamental 
fish, 
iguanas, 
lizards, 
snakes, 
frogs, 
and 
parrots); 
and 
traditional 
medicines 
and 
tonics 
(e.g., 
sea 
turtle 
eggs, 
jaguar 
parts, 
and 
reptiles). 
Domestic 
demand 
markets, 
particularly 
in 
larger 
Caribbean 
countries, 
also 
contribute 
to 
illegal 
trade 
for 
wildlife 
as 
pets, 
meat, 
and 
traditional 
medicines. 
Wildlife 
trafficking 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
one 
of 
the 
main 
threats 
to 
wildlife 
in 
the 
region. 
These 
pressures 
on 
wildlife 
have 
direct 
impacts 
on 
the 
ecosystems, 
communities, 
and 
livelihoods 
that 
depend 
on 
them, 
including 
rural 
and 
indigenous 
peoples, 
and 
other 
communities 
living 
in 
poverty 
and 
whose 
wellbeing 
are 
closely 
tied 
to 
the use and conservation of biodiversity. 


Overall 
there 
is 
a 
paucity 
of 
available 
information 
in 
many 
of 
the 
countries 
about 
various 
aspects 
of 
the 
illegal 
wildlife 
trade. 
This 
becomes 
more 
evident 
on 
a 
country-by-country 
basis. 
As 
a 
general 
trend, 
larger 
Caribbean 
countries 
tended 
to 
have 
more 
established 
information 
on 
illegal 
wildlife 
trade 
as 
compared 
to 
smaller 
Organization 
of 
Eastern 
Caribbean 
States 
(OECS) 
member 
countries 
and 
Barbados. 
Though 
trade 
was 
not 
fully 
determined 
in 
the 
smaller 
countries, 
these 
areas 
may 
unwittingly 
be 
used 
as 
transshipment points. 


Illegal, 
unreported 
and 
unregulated 
fishing 
(IUU 
fishing) 
is 
also 
considered 
a 
majorthreat 
to 
fisheries 
resources 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
region, 
undermining 
regional 
efforts 
to 
conserve 
and 
manage 
fish 
stocks. 
IUU 
fishing 
also 
prevents 
governments 
of 
the 
Caribbean 
Countries 
from 
achieving 
their 
nationally 
and 
regionally 
agreed-upon 
fisheries 
management 
goals 
and 
objectives. 
IUU 
fishing 
leads 
to 
the 
loss 
of 
both 
short 
and 
long-term 
social 
and 
economic 
opportunities 
and 
to 
negative 
effects 
on 
food 
security 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
If 
IUU 
fishing 
is 
not 
dealt 
with, 
it 
can 
lead 
to 
the 
collapse 
of 
fisheries or seriously impair efforts to rebuild stocks that have already been depleted. 


III. 
ALIGNMENTwithCARIBBEAN2020andUSAIDBIODIVERSITYPOLICY 
The 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
State, 
in 
coordination 
with 
USAID, 
submitted 
a 
multi-year 
Caribbean 
strategy 
to 
Congress 
on 
June 
19, 
2017 
that 
establishes 
a 
framework 
for 
enhancing 
the 
security 
and 
prosperity 
of 
the 
Caribbean 
region. 
Considered 
the 
"third 
border" 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
Caribbean 
is 
a 
vital 
part 
of 
USG 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
regional 
security 
cooperation, 
advance 
democratic 
principles, 
and 
increase 
trade 
and 
investment in the Western Hemisphere. 


A 
secure 
and 
stable 
Caribbean 
contributes 
to 
a 
safer 
and 
more 
prosperous 
United 
States 
by 
securing 
the 
U.S. 
border, 
protecting 
U.S. 
tourists, 
and 
increasing 
opportunities 
for 


U.S. 
businesses. 
The 
United 
States 
will 
continue 
to 
work 
with 
the 
Caribbean 
region 
to 

support 
commitments 
in 
the 
multi-year 
strategy, 
strengthen 
investments, 
and 
maximize 
partnerships for more sustainable growth and development in the Western Hemisphere. 


Included 
in 
this 
"Caribbean 
2020" 
strategy 
is 
the 
declaration 
that 
USG 
strategies 
in 
the 
region 
will 
promote 
sustainable 
tourism 
through 
fostering 
healthy, 
well-managed, 
and 
productive 
marine 
and 
coastal 
ecosystems, 
which 
are 
vital 
for 
the 
Caribbean 
tourism 
industry. The objectives of this program are aligned with this new regional strategy. 


IV. 
USAIDBIODIVERSITYPOLICY 
USAID 
aims 
to 
shape 
a 
future 
in 
which 
both 
people 
and 
biodiversity 
thrive 
via 
improvements 
in 
economic 
prosperity, 
social 
equity 
and 
environmental 
stewardship. 
The 
Agency’s 
first-ever 
Biodiversity 
Policy 
was 
published 
in 
2015 
and 
builds 
upon 
USAID’s 
long 
history 
of 
conserving 
biodiversity 
for 
current 
and 
future 
generations, 
and 
reflects 
our 
recognition of the role that healthy natural systems play in achieving development goals. 


The 
Biodiversity 
Policyrepresents 
our 
strengthened 
commitment 
to 
conserve 
biodiversity 
through: 
1) 
Strategic 
actions 
to 
conserve 
the 
world’s 
most 
important 
biodiversity, 
such 
as 
stamping 
out 
global 
wildlife 
trafficking; 
and 
2) 
A 
focus 
on 
integrating 
biodiversity 
and 
other 
development 
sectors 
for 
improved 
outcomes. 
The 
Policy 
recognizes 
that 
biodiversity 
loss 
can 
be 
driven 
by 
unsustainable 
development, 
that 
there 
are 
trade-offs 
between 
biodiversity 
conservation 
and 
development 
goals 
that 
must 
be 
understood 
and 
managed, 
and 
that 
biodiversity 
conservation 
itself 
can 
be 
a 
critical 
tool 
for 
achieving 
sustainable development. 


V. 
BIODIVERSITYandDEVELOPMENTINTERSECTIONS 
The 
Caribbean 
Biodiversity 
Program 
(CBP) 
promotes 
the 
security, 
safety 
and 
economic 
interests 
of 
the 
USG 
as 
well 
as 
core 
American 
identity 
values 
through 
its 
biodiversity 
programming. 
It 
is 
important 
that 
our 
neighboring 
countries 
have 
strong 
economies 
and 
employment 
opportunities. 
By 
protecting 
and 
conserving 
marine 
and 
coastal 
resources 
and 
strengthening 
the 
management 
of 
marine 
protected 
areas, 
USAID 
is 
also 
promoting 
sustainable 
fishing 
practices. 
A 
thriving 
and 
sustainable 
fishing 
sector 
will 
allow 
for 
increased 
economic 
opportunities 
for 
coastal 
community 
members 
and 
reduce 
illegal 
immigration to the United States. 


CBP 
has 
also 
contributed 
to 
increased 
maritime 
security 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
which 
leads 
to 
increased 
security 
along 
the 
coastlines 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
The 
Caribbean 
Sea 
is 
commonly 
used 
by 
traffickers 
of 
many 
illicit 
products 
which 
often 
end 
up 
in 
the 
U.S. 
CBP 
has 
worked 
to 
further 
strengthen 
the 
management 
of 
marine 
management 
areas, 
by 
developing 
marine 
spatial 
plans, 
hiring 
additional 
marine 
park 
wardens 
and 
procuring 
necessary 
equipment 
to 
increase 
enforcement 
capabilities. 
The 
increased 
management 
measures 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
marine 
park 
wardens 
with 
the 
necessary 
supplies 
(including 
boats 
and 
communications 
devices) 
deter 
the 
flow 
of 
narcotics 
and 
other 
illegal substances being transported into the United States. 


Lastly, 
many 
U.S.-based 
companies 
have 
businesses 
which 
depend 
on 
the 
rich 
natural 
resources 
of 
the 
Caribbean 
region, 
including 
American-owned 
hotels, 
restaurants, 
cruises 
and 
tour 
operators. 
Many 
U.S. 
companies 
import 
seafood 
from 
the 
Caribbean, 
including 



Caribbean 
spiny 
lobster 
and 
conch, 
which 
depend 
on 
healthy 
and 
resilient 
marine 
habitats. 


VI. 
STATEMENTOFTHECHALLENGE 
USAID 
aims 
to 
implement 
its 
first 
regional 
effort 
to 
combat 
wildlife 
trafficking 
as 
a 
means 
to 
reduce 
threats 
to 
biodiversity 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
region. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
Combating 
Wildlife 
Trafficking 
Activity 
(CWTA) 
is 
to 
reduce 
illegally 
traded 
wildlife 
from 
the 
wider-caribbean 
region. 
The 
activity 
will 
achieve 
this 
purpose 
by 
reducing 
the 
illegal 
collection 
and 
poaching 
of 
wildlife 
for 
international 
trade 
related 
to 
demand 
for 
pets 
or 
collections, 
food, 
medicines, 
jewelry 
and 
crafts. 
Hence, 
strengthening 
efforts 
to 
combat 
wildlife 
trafficking 
(CWT) 
is 
an 
important 
component 
of 
this 
Agreement, 
tying 
directly 
to 
the 
U.S. 
National 
Strategy 
for 
Combating 
Wildlife 
Trafficking 
(11 
February 
2014) and its associated implementation plan (11 February 2015). 


The expected results of the CWTA are as illustrated in the diagram (See 
Attachment I): 


1. 
Increased 
capacity 
for 
effective 
enforcement 
& 
prosecution 
concerning 
wildlife 
crimes. 
2. 
International 
& 
interagency 
coordination 
& 
cooperation 
on 
illegal 
wildlife 
trade 
data sharing & enforcement strengthened. 
3. 
Outreach 
and 
awareness 
created 
for 
behavior 
change 
concerning 
wildlife 
trade 
and poaching. 
The 
Recipient 
is 
expected 
to 
leverage 
organizational 
existing 
networks, 
bringing 
in 
best 
practices, 
integration 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
other 
funding 
sources, 
along 
with 
unique 
partnering 
opportunities 
across 
the 
region. 
The 
recipient 
will 
work 
to 
integrate 
inclusive 
development 
considerations, 
such 
as 
gender 
dynamics, 
the 
needs 
of 
vulnerable 
populations 
and 
how 
to 
best 
develop 
strategies 
and 
approaches 
to 
meet 
the 
diverse 
needs 
of target groups. 


VII. 
PROJECTOVERVIEW 
The 
CBP 
has 
identified 
general 
trends 
in 
species 
trade, 
associated 
supply 
chains, 
and 
consumer 
markets. 
Thus, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
existing 
partners 
and 
governmental 
agencies 
working 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
illegal 
wildlife 
trade 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
region 
and 
critically 
evaluate 
existing 
and 
emerging 
threats 
to 
target 
species 
and 
wider 
biodiversity 
concerns. 
The 
project 
will 
further 
focus 
on 
the 
drivers 
of 
illegal 
trade 
and 
linkages 
to 
broader 
economic 
activity 
in 
the 
region, 
including 
tourism 
and 
partnerships 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
(i.e. 
airlines, 
cruise 
ships, 
airports, 
hotels, 
maritime 
logistics 
companies, 
etc.), to address the demand of wildlife products. 


The 
primary 
drivers 
of 
illegal 
killing 
and 
collecting 
of 
wildlife 
for 
international 
trade 
include 
the 
following: 
low 
risks 
to 
criminals 
and 
high 
profits 
from 
wildlife 
crime, 
private 
sector 
involvement 
enabling 
transport 
and 
use 
of 
illegal 
wildlife 
products, 
and 
increasing 
consumer 
demand 
(including 
demand 
for 
new 
products 
driven 
by 
recent 
immigration) 
for 
wildlife 
products 
and 
fish 
and 
seafood. 
Several 
indirect 
drivers 
contribute 
to 
these 
factors. 
For 
example, 
lack 
of 
coordination 
and 
collaboration 
among 
enforcement 
agencies 
and 
civil 
society, 
including 
the 
private 
sector, 
contributes 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
data 
to 
inform 
management 
decisions. 
These 
factors, 
in 
combination 
with 
a 
lack 
of 
resources, 
result 
in 



insufficient 
capacity 
to 
develop 
and 
enforce 
measures 
to 
reduce 
environmental 
degradation; 
this 
leads 
to 
inadequate 
enforcement 
and 
prosecution 
of 
wildlife 
crime. 
Combined 
with 
the 
co-mingling 
of 
legally 
and 
illegally 
killed 
and 
collected 
wildlife, 
risks 
to 
wildlife 
criminals 
are 
low. 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
specific 
laws 
and 
regulations 
to 
implement 
the 
Convention 
on 
International 
Trade 
in 
Endangered 
Species 
of 
Wild 
Fauna 
and 
Flora 
(CITES) 
which 
results 
in 
outdated 
national 
environmental 
regulatory 
frameworks 
and 
documents 
that 
inadequately 
regulate 
species 
transport. 
Finally, 
a 
lack 
of 
awareness, 
education 
and 
practices, 
as 
well 
as 
insufficient 
public 
champions, 
contributes to increasing consumer demand both domestically and abroad. 


USAID 
recognizes 
the 
informational 
gaps 
related 
to 
CWT 
in 
the 
region 
such 
as 
understanding 
the 
consumer’s 
motivation 
for 
wildlife 
products 
(ornamental, 
pet, 
food, 
medicine, 
etc.). 
Hence, 
the 
problem 
analysis 
mentioned 
here 
should 
be 
revised 
by 
potential 
partners 
during 
the 
application 
development 
process. 
During 
start-up 
and 
the 
inception 
phase, 
USAID 
and 
partners 
will 
agree 
to 
focus 
on 
specific 
elements 
of 
the 
wildlife 
trade 
(species, 
trade 
route, 
or 
geography), 
collect 
additional 
information 
to 
address 
any 
gaps 
and 
refine/revise 
strategic 
approaches. 
New 
information 
gathered 
will 
be 
cross-referenced 
to 
linkages 
to 
organized 
crime 
and 
other 
forms 
of 
illicit 
criminal 
activity, as well as to linkages with IUU. 


The 
CBP 
expects 
the 
selected 
partner/s 
to 
work 
through 
the 
stakeholders 
identified 
through 
the 
systems 
mapping 
exercises 
(see 
Attachment 
II) 
provided 
in 
this 
document. 
Selected 
partner(s) 
are 
expected 
to 
refine 
or 
adapt 
the 
provided 
systems 
mapping 
in 
the 
activity 
start 
up 
phase 
in 
order 
to 
address 
the 
following 
strategic 
approaches. 
This 
may 
result 
in 
the 
identification 
of 
additional 
partners 
that 
can 
make 
significant 
contributions 
in 
addressing trafficking in wildlife. 


VIII. 
STRATEGICAPPROACHES&THEORIESOFCHANGE 
The 
CWTA 
objectives 
will 
be 
achieved 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
all 
three 
of 
the 
three 
strategic 
approaches, 
namely 
1) 
Social 
and 
Behavior 
Change 
Communication 
(SBCC), 
2) 
Strengthening 
international 
& 
interagency 
coordination 
& 
cooperation 
in 
data 
sharing 
& 
enforcement, 
and 
3) 
Building 
capacity 
for 
effective 
enforcement 
and 
prosecution. 
The 
CBP 
is 
flexible 
and 
open 
to 
validating 
the 
appropriateness/feasibilityof 
the strategic approaches with a partner post-award. 


The 
CBP 
will 
also 
consider 
potential 
partner 
feedback 
on 
the 
logic 
described 
below 
and 
expect 
to 
revise 
it 
to 
be 
more 
context-specific 
post-award 
no 
later 
than 
2 
months 
post 
award. 


1) 
Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) 
The 
CBP 
has 
identified 
the 
lack 
of 
information 
and 
awareness 
in 
the 
region 
on 
wildlife 
trafficking 
and 
its 
detriment 
to 
the 
overall 
development 
and 
sustainability 
of 
countries 
in 
the 
Caribbean. 
The 
social 
and 
behavior 
change 
strategic 
approach 
contemplates 
the 
use 
of 
social 
marketing 
and 
other 
methodologies 
to 
raise 
awareness 
and 
change 
the 
behaviors 
of 
target 
audiences, 
especially 
consumer 
choices 
and 
reporting 
of 
illegal 
products 
and 
markets. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
once 
the 
target 
audience 
receives 
the 
messages, 
and 
barriers 
to 
behavior 
change 
are 
removed 
or 
enabling 
factors 
for 
behavior 
change 
are 
put 
in 
place, 
the 
target 



audience 
should 
begin 
to 
express 
the 
desired 
attitudes 
and 
talk 
with 
others 
about 
it 
(interpersonal 
communications), 
which 
will 
help 
with 
uptake 
of 
the 
message 
and 
further 
expression 
of 
desired 
attitudes 
by 
members 
of 
the 
target 
audience. 
When 
barriers 
are 
removed, 
attitudes 
are 
changed, 
and 
interpersonal 
communication 
occurs 
frequently, 
then 
the 
target 
audience 
should 
demonstrate 
the 
desired 
behavior, 
leading 
to 
fewer 
sales 
and 
reduced 
profits 
from 
wildlife 
crime. 
This 
should 
lead 
to 
reduced 
occurrences 
of 
wildlife 
crime 
and 
improvements 
in 
the 
status 
of 
protected 
and 
regulated 
species. 
Further, 
the 
target 
audience 
adopts 
the 
desired 
attitudes 
and 
communicates 
with 
others 
(beyond 
the 
target 
audience) 
about 
them, 
there 
should 
be 
a 
change 
in 
the 
social 
norms 
of 
the 
larger 
population, 
including 
improved 
perception 
of 
the 
value 
of 
wildlife, 
as 
well 
as 
awareness 
of, 
and concern for, the consequences of wildlife crime. 


2) 
Strengthening International & Interagency coordination & cooperation in 
data sharing & enforcement 
The 
CBP 
has 
identified 
the 
importance 
of 
fostering 
support 
for 
national 
and 
international 
systems 
and 
processes 
to 
improve 
coordination 
and 
cooperation 
among 
agencies, 
institutions 
and 
organizations 
to 
combat 
wildlife 
crime. 
Theneed 
to 
study 
coordination 
opportunities 
and 
gaps 
to 
identify 
coordination 
opportunities 
should 
be 
further 
explored, 
in 
addition 
to 
enabling 
conditions 
for 
data 
sharing 
and 
collaborative 
enforcement. 
Implementation 
of 
reformed 
data 
sharing 
processes 
should 
improve 
international 
and 
interagency 
data 
sharing, 
as 
wellas 
internationalandinteragencycollaborationinenforcement.Theseresults 
should 
lead 
to 
improved 
enforcement 
and 
prosecution 
of 
existing 
laws 
and 
agreements. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
improved 
enforcement 
and 
prosecution, 
the 
risks 
of 
negative 
consequences 
for 
wildlife 
criminals 
are 
expected 
to 
increase, 
which 
should 
reduce 
profits 
derived 
from 
wildlife 
crime. 
Reduced 
profits 
should 
also 
result 
directly 
from 
improved 
enforcement 
and 
prosecution. 
Increased 
risks 
and 
reduced 
profits 
should 
lead 
to 
reduced 
levels 
of 
wildlife 
crime 
and 
to 
improvements 
in 
the 
status 
of 
protected 
and 
regulated 
species. 
Additionally, 
trust 
and 
camaraderie 
across 
agencies 
can 
directly 
lead 
to 
informal 
data 
sharing 
that 
can then lead to improved enforcement and prosecution. 


3) 
Build capacity for effective enforcement and prosecution. 
Through 
training 
and 
awareness 
of 
customs 
officials, 
judges, 
and 
other 
enforcement 
officials 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
desired 
competencies 
are 
acquired 
and 
maintained 
by 
targeted 
countries. 
When 
combined 
with 
adequate 
resources 
and 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
enabling 
conditions, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
this 
will 
lead 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
desired 
compliance 
and 
enforcement 
actions. 
This 
should 
improve 
the 
enforcement 
and 
prosecution 
of 
existing 
laws 
and 
agreements, 
which 
should 
increase 
the 
risks 
to 
wildlife 
criminals, 
reducing 
their 
profits 
and 
overall 
levels 
of 
wildlife 
crime. 
To 
achieve 
the 
results 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
change, 
strategic 
approaches 
to 
support 
national 
and 
sub-national 
policy 
and 
legislative 
reforms 
may 
be 
needed 
to 
enable 
adequate 
institutional 
support 
for 
staff 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
conditions 
for 
institutionalization 
of 
competencies, 
and to improve enforcement and prosecution of existing laws and agreements. 



IX. 
ACTIVITYINDICATORSANDPERFORMANCEMEASURES 
The 
main 
objective 
of 
the 
CWTA 
is 
to 
conserve 
illegally 
traded 
wildlife 
from 
the 
wider-caribbean 
region. 
Achieving 
this 
objective 
will 
require 
reducing 
illegal 
killing 
or 
collection 
for 
international 
trade, 
which 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
reduction 
of 
threats 
to 
marine-coastal 
biodiversity 
in 
priority 
areas 
using 
an 
integrated, 
ecosystem-based 
approach. 
The 
successful 
applicant 
will 
establish 
appropriate 
targets 
to 
be 
achieved 
within 
the 
life 
of 
the 
activity. 
In 
order 
to 
achieve 
the 
top 
line 
result, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
CWTA will make progress in the following three areas: 


● Demand reduction through behavior change; 
● International Cooperation on CWT issues enhanced 
● Enforcement related to CWT strengthened. 
Interested, 
eligible 
organizations 
are 
encouraged 
to 
propose 
innovative 
activities 
and 
suitable 
indicators 
to 
meet 
the 
activity 
objectives 
described. 
Activity 
outcomes 
will 
contribute 
to 
advancing 
USAID’s 
Biodiversity 
Policy. 
USAID 
and 
its 
partners 
view 
biodiversity 
as 
a 
critically 
important 
foundation 
for 
human 
welfare, 
intricately 
connected 
to 
other 
development 
sectors 
and 
fundamental 
to 
meeting 
USAID’s 
development 
goals. 
The 
goal 
of 
the 
Biodiversity 
Policy 
is 
to 
advance 
biodiversity 
conservation 
as 
an 
essential 
component of human development. 


Under the Policy, all activities receiving biodiversity funds must meet these criteria: 


1. 
The 
program 
must 
have 
an 
explicit 
biodiversity 
objective 
and 
stated 
Theory 
of 
Change (TOC). 
2. 
Activities 
must 
be 
based 
on 
an 
analysis 
of 
drivers 
and 
threats 
to 
biodiversity 
loss 
and the corresponding Theory of Change. 
3. 
Site-based 
programs 
must 
have 
the 
intent 
to 
positively 
impact 
biodiversity 
in 
biologically significant areas. 
4. 
Activities 
must 
monitor 
all 
indicators, 
including 
relevant 
standard 
USG 
Foreign 
Assistance 
Framework 
indicators 
(see 
below), 
associated 
with 
the 
stated 
Theory 
of Change for biodiversity conservation. 
The 
activity 
also 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
LAC 
Regional 
Programs 
which 
recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
both 
Global 
Climate 
Change 
(GCC) 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation 
in 
LAC 
Missions’ 
work 
and 
notes, 
“Biodiversity 
loss 
and 
natural 
resource 
degradation 
also 
threaten 
to 
undermine 
progress 
towards 
sustained 
economic 
prosperity 
and 
democratic 
stability.” 
Biodiversity 
work 
falls 
under 
Development 
Goal 
4: 
“Transition 
to 
climate-resilient, 
low-emission, 
sustainable 
economic 
growth 
accelerated.” 
Further, 
the 
activity 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
strategies 
of 
USAID 
Missions 
and/or 
Operating 
Units 
in 
countries in which it is active. 


Results 
to 
be 
achieved 
must 
be 
measured 
by 
relevant 
standard 
USG 
Foreign 
Assistance 
Framework indicators such as the following: 


● 
EG 
10.2-4: 
Number 
of 
people 
receiving 
USG-supported 
training 
in 
natural 
resource management and/or biodiversity conservation. 
● 
EG.10.2-5: 
Number 
of 
laws, 
policies, 
or 
regulations 
that 
address 
biodiversity 
conservation 
and/or 
other 
environmental 
themes 
officially 
proposed, 
adopted 
or 
implemented as a result of USG assistance 
10 



● 
EG.10.2-6: 
Number 
of 
people 
that 
applyimproved 
conservation 
law 
enforcement 
practices as a result of USG assistance. 
The following are examples of custom indicators: 


● 
Number 
of 
partners 
working 
together 
through 
national 
and 
international 
level 
operational 
wildlife 
crime 
coordination 
mechanisms. 
OR 
Increased 
national, 
regional, 
and 
international 
law 
enforcement 
collaboration 
and 
cooperation 
on 
combating wildlife trafficking. 
● 
Change 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
people 
with 
positive 
behavior 
change 
concerning 
wildlife trade and poaching. 
The 
selected 
applicant 
will 
be 
required 
to 
provide 
a 
comprehensive 
Monitoring, 
Evaluation 
and 
Learning 
Plan 
(MELP) 
due 
90 
days 
after 
the 
award 
has 
been 
granted, 
including 
proposed 
indicators, 
and 
baselines 
as 
relevant, 
and 
end-of-activity 
targets. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
standard 
Framework 
indicators 
listed 
above, 
applicants 
are 
required 
to 
propose 
additional 
custom 
indicators 
to 
demonstrate 
cross-cutting 
impacts 
on 
economic 
growth 
and 
governance. 
All 
people-level 
data 
must 
be 
sex 
disaggregated. 
All 
data 
must 
also 
be 
disaggregated 
by 
location 
(country-level) 
to 
facilitate 
communication 
with 
local 
governments. All data must meet USAID’s data quality standards. 


The 
successful 
applicant 
or 
offeror 
must 
have 
an 
approved 
Activity 
MELP 
in 
place 
before 
major 
implementation 
actions 
begin. 
Key 
components 
of 
an 
Activity 
MELP 
include: 


● 
The 
activity’s 
monitoring 
approach, 
including 
relevant 
performance 
indicators 
of 
activity outputs and outcomes; 
● 
As 
appropriate, 
the 
activity’s 
approach 
for 
establishing 
effective 
procedures 
for 
collecting and responding to feedback from beneficiaries. 
● 
Any 
proposed 
internal 
and 
external 
evaluations; 
including 
any 
relevant 
preliminary evaluation questions; 
● 
The 
activity’s 
learning 
approach 
that 
will 
include 
processes 
and 
actions 
designed 
to: 
(1) 
identify 
and 
fill 
knowledge 
gaps 
through 
research, 
knowledge 
sharing, 
and 
outside 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training; 
(2) 
facilitate 
applicationof 
learning 
from 
assessments, 
evaluations 
and 
periodic 
monitoring 
and 
reflection 
processes; 
and 
(3) 
build 
sustained 
knowledge 
capture 
and 
sharing, 
across 
activities, 
partners, 
and 
sectors, 
and 
with 
key 
stakeholders 
from 
the 
USAID 
Mission 
and/or 
Operating 
Units, 
partner 
country 
government, 
and 
other 
donor 
funded 
activities 
through 
networking and collaboration; 
● 
Learning 
actions, 
including 
pause 
and 
reflect 
exercises, 
exchanges 
with 
other 
project 
activities, 
field 
visits, 
and 
knowledge 
capture 
at 
activity 
closeout 
and 
life 
of 
activity 
summary 
report. 
Learning 
actions 
are 
expected 
to 
engage 
and 
be 
useful 
not 
only 
to 
USAID, 
but 
to 
involve 
and 
inform 
activity 
beneficiariesand 
should 
be 
explicitly planned to inform activity decision points; 
● 
Estimated 
resources 
for 
these 
monitoring, 
evaluation, 
and 
learning 
actions 
that 
are 
a part of the implementing partner’s budget; 
● 
Roles 
and 
responsibilities 
for 
all 
proposed 
monitoring, 
evaluation, 
and 
learning 
actions. 
● 
The MELP should be revised as needed over the life of the activity in response to 
changes in context, learning, updates to the theory of change, and so forth.

X. 
GENDER AND SOCIAL INCLUSION 
The 
main 
findings 
of 
the 
Caribbean 
Development 
Program 
gender 
and 
social 
inclusion 
analysis 
found 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
populations 
within 
coastal 
communities 
to 
be 
women 
of 
all 
ages; 
indigenous 
peoples, 
rural 
women; 
the 
poorest 
households; 
fisherfolk, 
especially 
women 
fishers; 
women 
farmers; 
squatters; 
migrants 
(especially 
from 
Venezuela, 
Guyana, 
and 
Haiti); 
descendants 
of 
migrants; 
children; 
the 
elderly; 
young 
men 
and 
young 
women; 
single 
parents; 
persons 
living 
with 
HIV/AIDS; 
those 
who 
identify 
as 
LGBTI 
(especially 
transgender); 
sex 
workers; 
persons 
that 
are 
trafficked; 
persons 
of 
Afro 
descent; 
displaced 
people; 
and 
unemployed 
males. 
Vulnerable 
groups 
are most impacted by the loss of biodiversity and degradation of coastal areas. 


Gender 
considerations 
make 
an 
important 
difference 
in 
many 
natural 
resource 
programs 
and 
must 
be 
taken 
fully 
into 
account 
in 
this 
activity. 
Women’s 
access 
to 
and 
views 
on 
management 
of 
resources 
can 
differ 
widely 
from 
the 
perspectives 
of 
their 
male 
counterparts; 
special 
attention 
needs 
to 
be 
paid 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
views 
of 
both 
genders 
are 
brought 
into 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
activity 
in 
a 
meaningful 
and 
effective 
way. 
The 
MELP 
will also include gender sensitive indicators. 


The 
partner 
is 
expected 
to 
clearly 
state 
in 
the 
work 
plan, 
the 
MELP 
and 
other 
relevant 
documents 
how 
their 
activities 
will 
consider 
and 
integrate 
inclusive 
development 
considerations, 
such 
as 
gender 
dynamics, 
the 
needs 
of 
vulnerable 
populations 
and 
how 
to 
best develop strategies and approaches to meet the diverse needs of target groups. 


a) 
Geolocation Data 
Geographic 
Information 
System 
(GIS) 
data 
USAID 
is 
required 
to 
make 
nonproprietary 
geospatial 
data 
available 
to 
the 
public. 
Data 
must 
be 
consistent 
with 
U.S. 
Federal 
Geographic 
Data 
Committee 
(FGDC) 
level 
1 
metadata 
standards. 
All 
spatial 
and 
geographic 
information 
system 
activities 
financed 
by 
USG 
federal 
funds 
must 
comply 
with: 


a. 
OMB Circular A-16, Executive Order 12906; 
b. 
Automated Directives System (ADS) 507 (Freedom of Information Act); 
c. 
ADS 551 (Data Administration); and 
d. 
ADS 557 (Public Information). 
e. 
ADS 579 (Activity Location Data) 
f. 
ADS 201 (Data disaggregation by Geographic location) 
Therefore, 
the 
awardee 
must 
collect, 
analyze, 
and 
share 
activity 
exact 
site 
location 
level 
data 
for 
the 
implementation 
sites 
and 
at 
a 
minimum, 
collect 
the 
location 
of 
intended 
beneficiaries 
at 
the 
administrative 
unit 
1 
level, 
e.g., 
region, 
province, 
etc. 
The 
information 
should 
be 
submitted 
to 
USAID 
following 
one 
(1) 
year 
after 
the 
start 
date 
of 
the 
award 
and 
on October 30 of each subsequent year: 
a. 
Digital 
spatial 
data 
according 
to 
Federal 
Geographic 
Data 
Committee 
(FGDC) 
Level 
1 
metadata 
standards 
capturing 
GIS 
at 
the 
regional, 
administrative, 
community, and municipality level for their zones of intervention; 
b. 
Digital copies of spatial data with accompanying metadata; and 
c. 
Make spatial data available to the public at the cost of reproduction. 
12 



The 
recipient 
is 
expected 
to 
analyze 
Activity 
Location 
Data 
with 
other 
monitoring 
data 
to 
inform 
efforts 
to 
manage 
adaptively 
and 
promote 
accountability. 
The 
Activity 
MELP 
must 
consider 
indicator 
disaggregation 
by 
geographic 
location. 
When 
geographically 
disaggregated 
indicators 
are 
included, 
the 
MELP 
must 
indicate 
the 
level 
of 
geographic 
detail at which the indicator data will be collected. 


XI. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND PROTECTION 
The 
Foreign 
Assistance 
Act 
of 
1961, 
as 
amended, 
Section 
117 
requires 
that 
the 
impact 
of 
USAID’s 
activities 
on 
the 
environment 
be 
considered 
and 
that 
USAID 
include 
environmental 
sustainability 
as 
a 
central 
consideration 
in 
designing 
and 
carrying 
out 
its 
development 
programs. 
This 
mandate 
is 
codified 
in 
Federal 
Regulations 
(22 
CFR 
216) 
and 
in 
USAID’s 
Automated 
Directives 
System 
(ADS) 
Parts 
201.5.10g 
and 
204 
(http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/200/), 
which, 
in 
part, 
require 
that 
the 
potential 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
USAID-financed 
activities 
are 
identified 
prior 
to 
a 
final 
decision 
to 
proceed 
and 
that 
appropriate 
environmental 
safeguards 
are 
adopted 
for 
all 
activities. 
Respondent 
environmental 
compliance 
obligations 
under 
these 
regulations 
and 
procedures are specified in the following paragraphs of this NOFO. 


In 
addition, 
the 
recipient 
mustcomply 
with 
host 
country 
environmental 
regulations 
unless 
otherwise 
directed 
in 
writing 
by 
USAID. 
In 
case 
of 
conflict 
between 
host 
country 
and 
USAID regulations, the latter shall govern. 


No 
activity 
funded 
under 
this 
RFA 
will 
be 
implemented 
unless 
an 
environmental 
threshold 
determination, 
as 
defined 
by 
22 
CFR 
216, 
has 
been 
reached 
for 
that 
activity, 
as 
documented 
in 
a 
Request 
for 
Categorical 
Exclusion 
(RCE), 
Initial 
Environmental 
Examination 
(IEE), 
or 
Environmental 
Assessment 
(EA) 
duly 
signed 
by 
the 
Bureau 
Environmental 
Officer 
(BEO). 
(Hereinafter, 
such 
documents 
are 
described 
as 
“approved 
Regulation 216 environmental documentation.”) 


An 
Initial 
Environmental 
Examination 
(IEE) 
(LAC-IEE-18-52) 
has 
been 
approved 
for 
the 
activity 
funding 
this 
RFA. 
The 
IEE 
covers 
activities 
expected 
to 
be 
implemented 
under 
any 
Cooperative 
Agreement 
awarded 
as 
a 
result 
of 
this 
NOFO. 
USAID 
has 
determined 
that 
a 
Negative 
Determination 
with 
conditions 
applies 
to 
one 
or 
more 
of 
the 
potential 
activities. 
This 
indicates 
that 
if 
these 
activities 
are 
implemented 
subject 
to 
the 
specified 
conditions, 
they 
are 
expected 
to 
have 
no 
significant 
adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
environment. 
The 
applicant 
shall 
be 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
all 
IEE 
conditions 
pertaining 
to 
activities to be funded under this solicitation. 


As 
part 
of 
its 
initial 
Work 
Plan 
and 
all 
Annual 
Work 
Plans 
thereafter, 
the 
recipient, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
USAID 
Cognizant 
Technical 
Officer 
and 
Mission 
Environmental 
Officer 
or 
Bureau 
Environmental 
Officer, 
as 
appropriate, 
shall 
review 
all 
ongoing 
and 
planned 
activities 
under 
this 
Cooperative 
Agreement 
to 
determine 
if 
they 
are 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
approved 
Regulation 
216 
environmental 
documentation. 
If 
the 
recipient 
plans 
any 
new 
activities 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
theapproved 
Regulation 
216 
environmental 
documentation, 
it 
shall 
prepare 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
documentation 
for 
USAID 
review 
and 
approval. 
No 
such 
new 
activities 
shall 
be 
undertaken 
prior 
to 
receiving 
written 
USAID 
approval 
of 
environmental 
documentation 
amendments. 
Any 
ongoing 
activities 
found 
to 
be 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
approved 
Regulation 
216 
environmental 


13 



documentation 
shall 
be 
halted 
until 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
documentation 
is 
submitted 
and 
written approval is received from USAID. 


When 
the 
approved 
Regulation 
216 
documentation 
is 
an 
IEE 
that 
contains 
one 
or 
more 
Negative 
Determinations 
with 
conditions, 
the 
recipient 
shall 
prepare 
a 
complete 
environmental 
mitigation 
and 
monitoring 
plan 
(EMMP) 
or 
a 
project 
mitigation 
and 
monitoring 
(M&M) 
plan 
describing 
how 
the 
recipient 
will, 
in 
specific 
terms, 
implement 
all 
IEE 
conditions 
that 
apply 
to 
proposed 
project 
activities 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
award. 
The 
EMMP 
or 
M&M 
Plan 
shall 
include 
monitoring 
the 
implementationof 
the 
conditions 
and 
their 
effectiveness. 
The 
recipient 
shall 
integrate 
a 
completed 
EMMP 
or 
M&M 
Plan 
into 
the 
initial 
work 
plan 
and 
subsequent 
Annual 
Work 
Plans, 
making 
any 
necessary 
adjustments 
to 
activity 
implementation 
in 
order 
to 
minimize 
adverse 
impacts 
to 
the 
environment. 


To 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
USAID 
environmental 
regulation 
22 
CFR 
216, 
the 
Recipient 
is 
responsible 
for 
providing 
an 
Environmental 
Mitigation 
and 
Monitoring 
Plan 
(EMMP) 
and 
Environmental 
Mitigation 
and 
Monitoring 
Report 
(EMMR), 
as 
outlined 
in 
the 
guidelines 
at 
https://www.usaid.gov/environmental-procedures. 
The 
Recipient 
will 
ensure 
that 
appropriate 
environmental 
guidelines 
are 
followed, 
that 
mitigation 
measures 
described 
in 
the 
pertinent 
Threshold 
Decision 
for 
each 
of 
these 
activities 
are 
funded 
and 
implemented, 
including 
any 
necessary 
training 
or 
capacity 
building, 
and 
adequate 
monitoring. 


USAID 
anticipates 
that 
environmental 
compliance 
and 
achieving 
optimal 
development 
outcomes 
for 
the 
proposed 
activities 
will 
require 
environmental 
management 
expertise. 
Respondents 
to 
the 
NOFO 
should 
therefore 
include 
their 
approach 
to 
achieving 
environmental 
compliance 
and 
management 
as 
part 
of 
their 
application, 
to 
include 
the 
following: 
The 
respondent’s 
approach 
to 
developing 
and

II. 
EXPECTED 
PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS, 
TARGETS, 
BASELINE 
DATA, AND DATA COLLECTION 
The 
objectives 
of 
the 
CWTA 
will 
be 
measured 
using 
the 
following 
standard 
performance 
indicators: 


● 
EG 
10.2-4: 
Number 
of 
people 
receiving 
USG-supported 
training 
in 
natural 
resource management and/or biodiversity conservation. 
● 
EG.10.2-5: 
Number 
of 
laws, 
policies, 
or 
regulations 
that 
address 
biodiversity 
conservation 
and/or 
other 
environmental 
themes 
officially 
proposed, 
adopted 
or 
implemented as a result of USG assistance 
● 
EG.10.2-6: 
Number 
of 
people 
that 
applyimproved 
conservation 
law 
enforcement 
practices as a result of USG assistance. 
The 
partner 
is 
expected 
to 
complement 
these 
indicators 
with 
custom 
indicators 
that 
will 
monitor performance under each objective, after approved in the MELP. 


It 
is 
also 
expected 
that 
CWTA 
will 
include 
context 
indicators 
that 
will 
help 
monitor 
external 
factors 
and 
uncertainties 
that 
could 
affect 
programs 
and 
adapt 
programming 
to 
the 
context 
accordingly. 
Indicators 
are 
expected 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
Missions 
and/or 
Operating 
Units’ 
Performance 
Management 
Plan 
for 
monitoring 
and 
external 
reporting 
requirements, 
such 
as 
the 
Mission’s 
annual 
Performance 
Plan 
and 
Report 
(PPR), 
and 
it 
should 
also 
fulfills 
the 
program-monitoring 
needs 
for 
the 
management 
and 
oversight 
of 
activities by USAID. 


15 



As 
part 
of 
the 
MELP, 
the 
partner 
is 
responsible 
for 
collecting 
baseline 
data 
for 
their 
performance indicators and setting appropriate targets based on the theory of change. 


Additionally, 
the 
partner 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
establishing 
effective 
procedures 
for 
collecting 
and 
responding 
to 
beneficiary 
feedback 
and 
report 
on 
those 
findings 
and 
partner 
responses 
back 
to 
USAID. 
Furthermore, 
the 
partner 
will 
outline 
learning 
approaches, 
which 
include 
learning 
questions 
in 
the 
MELP, 
with 
learning 
findings 
collected 
regularly 
based 
on 
learning 
from 
monitoring 
data, 
site 
visits, 
evaluations, 
beneficiary feedback, or other sources of information to guide adaptations as needed. 


Data 
will 
be 
collected 
and 
reported 
to 
USAID 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis, 
and 
it 
must 
meet 
USAID’s data quality standards as per ADS 201.3.5.7. 


III. 
START 
DATE 
AND 
PERIOD 
OF 
PERFORMANCE 
FOR 
FEDERAL 
AWARD 
The 
anticipated 
period 
of 
performance 
is 
3 
years. 
The 
estimated 
start 
date 
will 
be 
from 
September 27, 2022 through September 2025. 


IV. 
SUBSTANTIAL INVOLVEMENT 
Per 
guidance 
in 
Automated 
Directive 
System 
(ADS) 
303.3.11, 
the 
Agreement 
Officer 
(AO) 
requires 
substantial 
involvement 
during 
the 
administration 
of 
this 
award 
to 
ensure 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
program 
objectives. 
The 
AO 
will 
appoint 
an 
Agreement 
Officer’s 
Representative 
(AOR) 
for 
the 
award, 
who 
will 
serve 
as 
the 
main

between 
USAID and this award to assist in substantial involvement. 


USAID’s 
substantial 
involvement 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
program 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
approval 
by 
the 
AOR 
as 
delegated 
by 
the 
AO 
of 
the 
elements 
listed 
below, 
except 
for 
any 
changes 
to 
the 
program 
description 
or 
the 
approved 
budget 
that 
requires 
AO approval. 


a. 
Agency’s approval of the Recipient’s implementation plans 
Implementation 
plans 
include, 
but 
are 
not 
limited 
to, 
annual 
work 
plans, 
including 
planned 
activities 
for 
the 
following 
year 
and 
any 
subsequent 
revisions, 
planned 
expenditures, 
knowledge 
management 
plans, 
event 
planning/management, 
international 
meeting 
preparation, 
and 
research 
studies/protocols. 


USAID 
requires 
the 
approval 
of 
implementation 
plans 
annually 
to 
ensure 
alignment 
with 
stated 
goals 
and 
outputs. 
The 
implementation 
plan 
communicates 
how 
and 
when 
the 
Recipient 
will 
complete 
project 
activities 
and 
is 
drafted 
annually 
to 
describe 
new 
activities. 
This 
plan 
will 
be 
developed 
in 
partnership 
between 
the 
Recipient 
and 
the 
AOR 
and 
his/her 
team. 
The 
AOR 


16 



will 
ensure 
that 
the 
implementation 
plan 
fits 
within 
the 
scope, 
terms, 
and 
conditions of the agreement. 


b. 
The Agency’s ability to immediately halt an activity if the Recipient does 
not meet detailed performance specifications 
These 
would 
be 
provisions 
that 
go 
beyond 
the 
suspension 
remedies 
of 
the 
Federal 
Government 
for 
noncompliance 
as 
stated 
in 
2 
Code 
of 
Federal 
Regulations 
(CFR) 
200, 
including 
non-performance. 
The 
AO 
may 
immediately 
halt 
an 
activity 
when 
identified 
specifications 
are 
not 
met. 
The 
award 
must 
include 
the 
identified 
specifications 
when 
executed. 
The 
AO 
and 
Recipient 
must 
sign 
a 
bilateral 
amendment 
for 
any 
material 
changes 
to 
the 
specifications in the award. 


c. 
Approval of key personnel positions. 
The 
Applicant 
shall 
identify 
each 
key 
personnel 
listed 
below 
by

will 
be 
reviewed 
based 
on 
the 
proposed 
approach,

and 
alignment 
with 
the 
above-referenced 
purpose 
of 
the 
Program 
Description 
in 
Section

legal 
and 
policy 
restrictions, 
including 
those 
set 
forth 
in 
USAID's 
Automated 
Directives 
System 
(ADS) 
and 
in 
the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. 


USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
will 
notify 
authors 
of

notes 
if 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
wishes 
to 
engage 
in 
further 
discussions/co-creation, 
maintain 
the 
application 
in 
a 
pool 
for 
potential 
future 
engagement, 
or

a 
round 
of 
co-creation 
with 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
prior 
to 
requesting 
submission 
of 
full 
application. 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
co-creation 
phase 
is 
to 
further 
define 
activity 
objectives, 
design 
interventions, 
align 
timelines, 
and 
finalize 
budgets. 
Through 
discussions, 
both 
the 
applicant(s) 
and 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
may 
identify 
additional 
resources, 
partners, 
or 
strategies 
necessary 
to 
successfully 
implement 
the 
activity. 
This 
process 
may 
involve 
extensive 
discussions 
with 
USAID/Washington, 
USAID 
Mission 
staff, 
or 
other 
experts, 
within 
or 
outside 
of 



USAID. 
Co-creation 
may 
happen 
in-person 
or 
virtually, 
through 
video 
conference, 
and/or phone calls. 


By

to 
this 
opportunity, 
applicants 
give 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
the 
right 
to 
share 
concept 
notes 
with 
appropriate 
external 
partnersfor 
the 
purposes 
of 
evaluation 
or 
co-creation. 
All 
parties 
privy 
to 
the 
contents 
of 
submitted 
concept 
notes, 
whether 
within 
or 
outside 
of 
USAID, 
will 
be 
required 
to 
keep 
contents 
in 
confidence. 
Additional 
information 
about 
the 
co-creation 
process 
can 
be 
found 
through 
USAID's 
Co-creation 
Toolkits 
and

Note: 
Communication 
with 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
during 
the 
concept 
note/co-creation 
phase 
should 
NOT 
be 
interpreted 
as 
a 
commitment 
to 
funding 
or 
guaranteed 
request 
for 
a 
full 
application. 
Any 
expenses 
incurred 
by 
applicants 
during 
this 
time 
are 
solely 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
applicants, 
unless 
otherwise 
stated in writing by USAID/Dominican Republic. 


If 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
decides 
to 
continue 
with 
the 
proposed 
activities 
following 
the 
co-creation 
phase, 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
will 
request 
a 
full 
application 
from 
the 
applicant, 
inclusive 
of 
all 
modifications, 
expansions, 
discussions, 
etc. 
resulting 
from 
the 
co-creation 
phase 
and 
will 
provide 
a 
full 
application 
templatefor 
completion. 


Phase IV: Full Application 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
will 
only 
request 
a 
full 
application 
from 
the 
applicant 
invited 
to 
continue 
in 
the 
application 
process. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
full 
application 
will 
expand 
upon 
their 
concept 
note 
and 
incorporate 
any 
discussions, 
ideas, 
plans, 
feedback 
or 
changes 
from 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
and 
other 
partners 
discussed 
during 
the 
co-creation 
phase. 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic 
will 
communicate 
required 
further 
expansion 
of 
the 
Concept 
Note 
content 
from 
the 
applicant, 
if 
necessary. 
Note: 
USAID/Dominican 
Republic's 
Request 
for 
Full 
Application

NOFO at the time of request for full application. 


a) 
SAM Requirements 
USAID 
may 
not 
award 
to 
an 
applicant 
unless 
the 
applicant 
has 
complied 
with 
all 
applicable 
unique 
entity 
identifier 
(UEI) 
and 
System 
for 
Award 
Management 
(SAM) 
requirements. 
Eachapplicant(unlesstheapplicantisanindividualorFederalawarding 
agency 
that 
is 
exempted 
from 
requirements 
under 
2 
CFR 
25.110(b) 
or 
(c), 
or 
has 
an 
exception 
approved 
by 
the 
Federal 
awarding 
agency 
under 
2 
CFR 
25.110(d)) 
is 
required to: 


1. 
Provide a valid UEI number for the applicant and all proposed sub-recipients; 
2. 
Be 
registered 
in 
SAM 
before 
award. 
SAM 
is 
streamlining 
processes, 
eliminating 
the 
need 
to 
enter 
the 
same 
data 
multiple 
times, 
and 
consolidating 
hosting 
to 
make 
the 
process 
of 
doing 
business 
with 
the 
government 
more 
efficient 
(www.beta.sam.gov). 
3. 
Continue 
to 
maintain 
an 
active 
SAM 
registration 
with 
current 
information 
at 
all 
times 
during 
which 
it 
has 
an 
active 
Federal 
award 
or 
an 
application 
or 
plan 
under consideration by a Federal awarding agency. 
The 
registration 
process 
may 
take 
many 
weeks 
to 
complete. 
Therefore, 
applicants 
are 
encouraged 
to 
begin 
the 
process 
early. 
If 
an 
applicant 
has 
not 
fully 
complied 
with 
the 
requirements 
above 
by 
the 
time 
USAID 
is 
ready 
to 
make 
an 
award, 
USAID 
may 
determine 
that 
the 
applicant 
is 
not 
qualified 
to 
receive 
an 
award 
and 
use 
that 
determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.

Conservation 
efforts 
often 
require 
work 
with 
and 
support 
to 
law 
enforcement 
personnel: 
park 
rangers, 
police, 
or 
other 
positions 
that 
may 
be 
deemed 
“foreign 
security 
forces.” 
Section 
119 
of 
the 
Foreign 
Assistance 
Act 
(FAA) 
permits 
support 
to 
law 
enforcement 
authorities 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
biodiversity 
conservation 
notwithstanding 
FAA 
Section 
660, 
which 
prohibits 
foreign 
assistance 
funding 
from 
being 
used 
to 
support 
foreign 
security 
forces. 
FAA 
Section 
119 
“notwithstanding 
authority” 
is 
relied 
on 
providing 
foreign 
assistance 
for 
law 
enforcement 
authorities, 
noting 
FAA 
Section 
660 
includes 
a 
provision exempting customs and maritime enforcement officials. 


Regardless 
of 
the 
“notwithstanding 
authority” 
invoked, 
USAID 
programs 
may 
not 
support provision of lethal technology or weapons. 


In 
order 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Joint 
Explanatory 
Statement 
to 
the 
FY 
2020 
Appropriations 
Act 
(often 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
Statement 
of 
Managers 
(SOM)), 
all 
existing 
USAID 
projects 
or 
activities 
concerning 
national 
parks 
and 
protected 
areas 
must 
be 
amended 
to 
require 
submission 
of 
a 
Social 
Impact 
Assessment 
and 
Implementation 
Plan, 
as 
described 
below. 
Interagency 
Agreements 
must 
also 
comply 
with the SOM. 


The 
Assessment must include the following required 
elements: 


1. 
A 
description 
of 
how 
the 
awardee 
will 
provide 
for 
community 
engagement 
about 
the 
project 
and 
its 
potential 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts, 
including 
consultation 
in 
accordance 
with 
USAID’s 
Policy 
on 
Promoting 
the 
Rights 
of 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
(Pro-IP 
Policy) 
when 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
affected; 
2. 
A description of how the awardee intends to: 
(a) 
assess 
the 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts 
of 
the 
proposed 
project, 
consistent 
with 
international 
best 
practices 
such 
as 
the 
IAIA 
social 
impact 
assessment 
guidance 
(https://www.iaia.org/uploads/pdf/SIA_Guidance_Document_IAIA.pdf), 
(b) avoid, mitigate or address negative impacts as appropriate, and 
(c) 
monitor 
the 
impacts 
of 
its 
proposal, 
with 
particular 
attention 
paid 
to 
the 
potential 
project 
impacts 
on 
land 
or 
resource 
rights 
claimed 
by 
affected 
local communities; 
3. 
A 
plan 
for 
training 
and 
monitoring 
any 
eco-guards, 
park 
rangers, 
and 
other 
law 
enforcement 
personnel 
authorized 
to 
protect 
biodiversity 
and 
engaged 
to 
achieve 
contract 
objectives 
regarding 
the 
professional 
and 
ethical 
execution 
of 
their 
duties, 
including 
upholding 
human 
rights 
and 
document 
compliance 
with 
this requirement, as appropriate; and 
36 



4. 
A 
Grievance 
and 
Redress 
Mechanism 
to 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
awardee, 
allowing 
members 
of 
the 
affected 
community 
to 
bring 
environmental 
and 
social 
grievances 
(including 
potential 
human 
rights 
violations) 
to 
the 
awardee, 
and 
a 
means 
for 
the 
Contractor 
to 
report 
all 
such 
grievances 
to 
the 
USAID 
COR/AOR 
within 72 hours.
