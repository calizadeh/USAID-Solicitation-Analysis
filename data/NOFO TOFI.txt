SECTION A: PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 

A.1 Authorizing Legislation 

This funding opportunity is authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as 
amended. The resulting award will be subject to 2 CFR 200 – Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and USAID’s 
supplement, 2 CFR 700, as well as the additional requirements found in Section F. 

A.2 Program Framework 

A.2.1 Purpose 

The purpose of the Trees Outside Forests in India (TOFI) activity is to expand the planting of 
trees outside of forests in India for enhanced provision of ecosystem services, especially carbon 
sequestration, and increased inclusive economic opportunities. Through the TOFI activity, 
USAID/India will support the Government of India (GoI) and other stakeholders to increase the 
uptake of trees outside of forests in India by: strengthening an enabling environment that 
promotes and incentivizes planting of trees; increasing economic opportunities from trees 
outside of forests; and improving access to information to help scale TOF in the country. 

 

A.2.2 Problem Statement 

In India’s context, Trees Outside Forests (TOFs) refers to all trees growing outside the 
government’s Recorded Forest Area (RFA). It includes trees growing on private land and farms; 
in urban areas; along linear infrastructure such as roads, railway lines, canals; plantations in and 
around industrial areas; shelterbelts; and in land belonging to government and other institutions; 
etc. TOFs on farms and other private lands provide income and sustenance for farmers from 
timber, fuelwood, fruits and other products. These TOFs play a critical role in the economy of 
many developing countries, including India1. Additionally, TOFs are important in promoting 
cultural, social, and ecological functions that are important to human livelihoods2. TOFs also 
sequester carbon, stabilize soil, filter water and air, regulate water flow, and perform other 
ecosystem services. When planted along roads and canals, in institutional areas or within urban 
landscapes, TOFs provide shade to cool microclimates, absorb some air pollutants, beautify 
green spaces, provide nesting and habitat for birds and other small animals, help to regulate 
stormwater, and contribute to human well-being.

In India, about a quarter of the population – roughly 300 million people – depends on forests for 
sustenance and livelihoods. This places extreme pressure on forests in the country, leading to 
increased forest degradation and loss of the goods and services that forests provide. 

 

TOFs can help to reduce forest degradation by providing additional sources of fuelwood, 
fodder, timber, bamboo, and other tree products (e.g., fruits, nuts). In India, agroforestry - a 
large subset of TOF, is being practiced by farmers in various forms. Agroforestry efforts help to 


provide goods and services which otherwise may have been sourced through clearing and 
cutting forests. In other words, TOFs can alleviate some pressure on natural forests. 

 

Despite these benefits, TOFs are an under-utilized strategy for achieving local, regional, and 
national objectives for rural livelihoods, income generation and employment, water security and 
ecosystem health, and international commitments related to tree cover, carbon sequestration, 
and land rehabilitation. The Trees Outside Forests in India (TOFI) activity aims to alleviate 
some of the impediments to TOFs so that India can better optimize the contributions TOFs can 
make toward these objectives. Several of these challenges and impediments are outlined in the 
subsequent sections. 

 

A.2.3 India’s forestry context 

India has more than 700,000 square kilometers of forest cover, or about 21.7% of its total 
geographic area. This represents an increase of almost 4,000 km2 (397,600 ha) in the past two 
years. 3In addition, tree cover on areas not counted as forest occupies more than 95,000 km2, 
another 2.9% of total geographic area. This combined 24.5% of forest and tree cover, however, 
remains well below the national target of 33% forest and tree cover4.

The GoI also has made a national commitment to sequester an additional 2.5 to 3 billion tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2030, as cited in a Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDC) submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
under the Paris Agreement. At the same time, the GoI committed to restore 26 million hectares 
of degraded lands by 2030 under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification 
(UNCCD) and its Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) initiative. 

 

In order to reach these national targets, much more land area would need to be brought under 
forest and tree cover. The GoI has adopted a two-pronged approach to reaching these targets: 

a. Increase the density of forest cover on degraded forest lands through restoration - for 
example, FSI calculated that restoration of forests could help reach up to 60% of the target for 
increased carbon sink at reasonable cost 5while also supporting the LDN target; and 
b. Increase tree cover outside forests through more widespread adoption of agroforestry - 
also calculated to be among the least-cost options for increasing the carbon sink.6 


 

Through activities such as the “Forest-PLUS 2.0: forests for water and prosperity”, 
USAID/India is working with GoI’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change 


(MoEFCC) to restore degraded forests in selected districts in the states of Bihar, Kerala, andTelangana. Forest-PLUS 2.0 represents part of the paradigm shift in India for management of 
forests withan emphasis on the critical role of forests for water security, soil moistureconservation, and catchment area rehabilitation while contributing toward India’s commitment 
for achieving NDC and LDN targets. Models being piloted in the three states are seen by 
MoEFCC as vital to enhancing ecosystem services, including biodiversity, hydrological services(including flood mitigation7), and carbon sequestration, through improved landscape 
management.

A.2.4India’s TOF context
The second approach to meeting thenational forest and tree cover targets, NDC targets, and 
LDN targets is focused on TOFs. Agroforestry onfarms and commercial private lands-thepredominant form of TOF-has the highest potential forincreasing carbon sequestration and 
restoring land while also providing economic benefits. Otheroptions for expanding tree coverthrough TOFs include planting green corridors along highways, railways, rivers and canals;
restoring degraded lands outside of forests; increasing urban green spaces, increasing treecoverin and around industrialareasto mitigate air and water pollution. The GoI recognizes that all ofthe available options need to be deployed in order to meetthe forestry targets.

Agroforestry is viewedas one of the best tools for optimizing farm productivity, increasingsmallholder incomes, and buildingresiliencein rural communities whilecontributing towardincreasingthe forest and treecover. Agroforestry inIndia generally takes the form ofhomegardens (generally under one hectare) on sloping land for household subsistence, mid-sized (2-5 
ha) tree farms intercropped with wheat or other annuals, or large commercial plantations of 
short-rotation pulp species.It is estimatedthat the combined area of these and other agroforestrysystems is between 11.5 and 25.3 million hectares.8

These agroforestry systems are important because they reduce pressure on forest lands for forestproducts, allowing thoseforeststo provide needed ecosystem services. More tree cover onprivate lands also helpsto rehabilitate and restore degraded land and allows these private landsto increasetheir contribution to ecosystem goods and services. For example, increased treecover storescarbon, helps to stabilize soil, andregulates water flow, reducing therisksassociated with flooding.9Increased tree coveralso expands habitat for pollinators needed foragricultural crops, as well as other biodiversity. Trees can help communitiesincrease theirresilience to climatechange and other shocks, notjust through protection from extremeevents, 
but by diversifying economic opportunities (through provision of fruits, wood, and othertreeproducts).

The GoI officially adopted its National Agroforestry Policy in 2014, the first country to do so. 
The National Agroforestry Policy was formulated to accomplish the following goals: 

1. Establish mechanisms for coordination, convergence, and synergy among ongoing but 
scattered programs related to agriculture, environment, forestry, and rural development 
by various ministries and sectors; 
2. Improve productivity, employment, income, and livelihood opportunities of smallholder 
farmers and other rural households through agroforestry; and 
3. Meet increasing demands for timber, food, fuel, fodder, fertilizer, fiber, and other agro-
forestry products while conserving natural forests, providing environmental protection 
and security, and increasing forest and tree cover, particularly outside natural forests. 


 

Under the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture led by the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW) through its Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers 
Welfare, a Sub-Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF) was established to support implementing the 
National Agroforestry Policy. A set of operational guidelines was published in 2016 to help 
States in meeting the SMAF objectives, including expanding integrated tree plantations, 
ensuring the availability of high-quality planting materials, popularizing viable agroforestry 
models suited to agro-ecological zones and climatic conditions, and providing knowledge 
management and extension support for agroforestry. 

 

While there has been an emphasis in the country on agroforestry (specially focused on farm 
land), other TOF options such as urban forests, along linear infrastructure, tree cover in and 
around industrial areas, etc that could provide substantial environmental benefits have not 
received the required impetus. 

 
A.2.5 Challenges 

Despite GoI’s commitment to TOF and the huge potential for TOF in India, adoption rates are 
low due to various challenges which can be categorized as: 

 

a. Challenges related to the enabling environment of regulations, finance and insurance, 
quality control, and other aspects of the policy, legal, and regulatory framework that currently 
inhibit more widespread adoption of productive and profitable planting of TOFs; 
b. Challenges related to the economic incentives, availability of biophysical and financial 
inputs and insurances, private sector investments, production practices, processing facilities, 
viable business models, and other aspects of the value chains for various tree species and the 
efficient functioning of markets for different products from TOFs; and 
c. Challenges related to the information on TOFs, including the generation, compilation, 
analysis, and dissemination of credible and accurate information on production, harvest, 
processing. 


 

A.2.6 Theory of Change 

The TOFI activity seeks to expand the uptake of TOFs in India for enhanced provision of 
ecosystem services and increased inclusive economic opportunities. The theory of change for 
TOFI, therefore, is that IF the impediments to successful TOF expansion in India are reduced or 


removed AND IF technical knowhow and high-quality planting material are available AND IF 
financing, insurance, and market opportunities are available THEN the area of trees outside of 
forests will increase, thereby improving inclusive economic opportunities, and enhancing 
ecosystem services including carbon sequestration. In doing so, TOFI will contribute toward 
India’s ability to meet its commitments as outlined above. 

 

Through the TOFI activity, USAID/India will strengthen management of natural resources as 
envisioned under DO3 of USAID’s India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) 
2020-2024 (https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1861/India_CDCS_2020-
2024.pdf ) 

 

A.2.7 Objectives and Key Results 

 

There are three objectives for this activity: 1. Strengthen the enabling environment for TOF 
expansion in India; 2. Incentivize TOF through reduced risks and improved economic 
opportunities; and 3. Enhance information systems and processes to support TOF. 

 

Several results are envisioned under each of the three objectives. Capacity building (including 
training) is considered essential to achieving these results. 

 

Objective 1: Enabling environment strengthened for TOF expansion in India 

 

Under this objective, USAID/India seeks for the TOFI activity to strengthen the enabling 
environment to facilitate expansion of TOF in target states, with particular emphasis on 
enabling conditions that support TOF uptake and expansion. This could include, among other 
things, stimulating demand for TOF products, quality standards and regulatory framework for 
nurseries, certification of TOF products, mobilizing financial resources, where applicable. 

 

 The required (R) and illustrative (I) results under this objective are provided below: 

 

Result 1.1: Consumer demand for certified TOF products enhanced; e.g., building codes 
revised to promote use of certified wood where applicable, sustainable procurement 
policies adopted by target states, or other actions undertaken to stimulate TOF demand 
(R) 

 

Result 1.2: Quality standards and regulatory framework for nurseries developed in target 
states to encourage production of high-quality planting materials for TOFs and 
certification systems for TOF products developed (I) 

 

Result 1.3: Analysis conducted to understand the factors that would enable an increase 
in CSR activities for TOF (I) 

 


Result 1.4: Resources mobilized to scale successful TOF models, e.g., CSR funds, or 
other public, private or philanthropic financial resources, as appropriate (R) 

 

Result 1.5: Technology demonstrated for monitoring and surveillance of agroforestry 
and forestry products in transit to minimize illicit products entering TOF value chains (I) 

 

Objective 2: TOF incentivized through reduced risks and improved economic 
opportunities 

 

Sustainably expanding TOFs requires that risks associated with tree growing are reduced and 
that tree growers get economic and environmental returns. That is, the material returns from 
devoting land to TOFs should be at least as much as returns from other potential land uses, 
recognizing that the returns may be intangible - such as a sense of well-being from a greener 
landscape as well as mitigating air and water pollution in case of industrial areas. Under this 
Objective, USAID intends to reduce or remove impediments to expansion of TOFs in ways that 
incentivizes economic and environmental returns to households, farmers and tree growers, other 
entities such as land owning institutions and TOF based enterprises. This could include, among 
others, increasing access to finance and insurance, promoting TOF based enterprises/value 
chains and providing business incubation support, skilling of workforce, demonstrating 
production of high quality seedling, establishing demonstration nurseries and plantations. 

 

 

The required (R) and illustrative (I) results under this objective are provided below: 

 

Result 2.1: Viable, innovative finance models for TOF developed and access to credit 
and insurance increased for farmers, FPOs, and MSMEs as needed to incentivize them 
to take advantage of TOF opportunities (R) 

 

Result 2.2: Capacity of financial and insurance agencies to evaluate TOF proposals 
strengthened and models/standards developed for the financial institutions to undertake 
due diligence of financing (credit/loan) proposals from farmers (I) 

 

Result 2.3: Business incubation and other support services provided based on need and 
demand from MSMEs, FDCs, FPOs, or other TOF/ wood-based enterprises (I) 

 

Result 2.4: TOF value chains & actors (e.g., FDCs, FPOs, MSMEs, corporates, 
traditional middlemen, local youth, disabled, landless) strengthened, including through 
setting up of TOF-based enterprises to respond to market demand and skill development. 
(R) 

 

Result 2.5: New and innovative TOF-based products and value chains established (I) 

 

Result 2.6: Model state-of-the-art nurseries established in target states to showcase best 
practices in the production of high-quality planting material at scales needed for TOF 
expansion (R) 


 

Result 2.7: A decision support tool for selecting appropriate tree species, including 
taking into consideration climate change scenarios, for various TOF options (R) 

 

Result 2.8: Demonstration plots established in private and institutional areas in target 
states to showcase best practices in raising good quality plantations and demonstration 
plots established in select industrial areas in target states to showcase best practices in 
growing trees for mitigation of air and water pollution (R) 

 

Objective 3: Enhanced information systems and processes on TOF 

Because TOFs have not yet become widespread despite GoI commitments to increasing tree 
cover, the third Objective of this activity is to enhance the systems and processes for TOF 
information so that they function more effectively. The long-term sustainability of efforts to 
increase tree cover in India through expanded TOFs will require an ongoing process of learning 
about what works under which conditions including future climates and markets. The 
information systems and processes need to support the generation, compilation, analysis, 
synthesis, packaging, and dissemination of a wide range of TOF-related information with the 
aim of having better information in the hands of more users. This could build on the strengths of 
the Van Vigyan Kendras established by State Forest Departments, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra 
network established by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, or similar types of 
extension service centers. 

 

The required (R) and illustrative (I) results under this objective are provided below: 

Result 3.1: Market information system for agroforestry products developed and a future 
market scenario developed (R) 

 

Result 3.2: Information on agroforestry models and practices strengthened (R) 

 

Result 3.3: Research supported for agroforestry productivity improvements (e.g., 
species, quality planting materials, silviculture, etc) (I) 

 

Result 3.4: Research supported for identifying suitable models and trees for restoration, 
reclamation of mined areas, plantations for industrial areas, etc. (I) 

 

Result 3.5: Evidence-base for reducing pollution through trees and forests strengthened 
(I) 

 

Result 3.6: Information dissemination service on TOF/ agroforestry strengthened(R) 

 

A.2.8 Proposed Geographic Targeting Criteria 

The selection of geographic targets will be conducted during the co-design (Phase 3) stage of 
the TOFI activity. In their response to the solicitation, offerors will propose criteria they would 


use to select five states representing key agro-ecological zones of India. The final selection of 
the states at the co-design stage would be subject to MoEFCC approval. 

 

A.2.9 Link to Agency Priorities 

The TOFI activity is aligned with India Country Development Cooperation Strategy (2020-24) 
and other broader USAID priorities such as the Journey to Self Reliance, Indo-Pacific Strategy, 
Private Sector Engagement Strategy, and Environment and Natural Resources Management 
Framework. 

 

A.2.10 Guiding Principles 

Leveraging: In addition to leveraging resources from the private sector for activity 
implementation, TOFI will also leverage resources from the public sector. The resources 
leveraged from both the sectors will enable the activity to engage in interventions that are of 
shared interest and will enable the interventions to be continued after the TOFI activity ends. At 
a minimum, the applicant is required to leverage 25% of the award amount from other sources. 

 

Coordination: USAID/India and the applicant will finalize the teaming arrangement/ 
consortium framework (if applicable) through the co-development process. The TOFI activity 
will engage with relevant host government ministries. The activity will coordinate with current 
USAID-funded activities and leverage the work of other relevant actors and stakeholders to 
ensure complementarity and avoid duplication of efforts. 

 

Gender and Social Inclusion: Please see Annex 3 for information on gender and social 
inclusion. 

Note: The term “program” as used in 2 CFR 200 and this NOFO is typically considered by 
USAID to be an Activity supporting one or more Project(s) pursuant to specific Development 
Objectives. Please see 2 CFR 700 for the USAID specific definitions of the terms “Activity” 
and “Project” as used in the USAID context for purposes of planning, design, and 
implementation of USAID development assistance.

SECTION B: FEDERAL AWARD INFORMATION 

B.1 Estimate of Funds Available and Number of Awards Contemplated 

USAID intends to award one Cooperative Agreement pursuant to this notice of funding 
opportunity. 

 

Subject to funding availability, successful ongoing implementation and at the discretion of the 
Agency, USAID in total government funding intends to provide US$19 Million through 
incremental funding over a five (5) year period. 


 

USAID reserves the right to change the funding amounts, cycle, and terms of the resulting 
Cooperative Agreement as a result of availability of funds and US Government requirements. 

The Recipient will be notified in writing should such changes occur. 

 

B.2 Expected Performance Indicators, Targets, Baseline Data, and Data Collection 

 Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning: A robust monitoring, evaluation, and learning 
approach will be adopted to ensure the tracking and reporting of results under the activity. The 
Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) plan should include the activity’s logic model, 
(logical framework and others), key performance indicators, performance indicator reference 
sheets, including draft targets for each indicator and information on data quality assurances; and 
a calendar of key performance management tasks. Further, the Plan should describe the process 
for monitoring, evaluating, and learning from implementation to adapt and achieve results. The 
TOFI activity should use results-based management and the performance metrics approach, as a 
tool for activity design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. 

 

Tentative list of indicators to monitor results is given below. The final list of indicators will be 
developed during the co-design stage. 

 

● Number of state-of-the art-nurseries set up 
● Number of hectares under improved management practices or technologies with USG 
assistance [FTF EG.3.2.-25] 
● Number of people trained on nursery techniques, TOF plantations and value addition 
● Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, estimated in metric tons of CO2 equivalent, reduced, 
sequestered, or avoided through sustainable landscapes activities supported by USG 
assistance (EG.13-6) 
● Projected greenhouse gas emissions reduced or avoided through 2030 from adopted 
laws, policies, regulations, or technologies related to sustainable landscapes as supported 
by USG assistance (EG.13-7) 
● Number of institutions with improved capacity to address sustainable landscapes issues 
as supported by USG assistance (EG.13-2) 
● Number of financial institutions whose capacities are built to undertake due diligence of 
TOF proposals for loans. 
● TOF enterprises, producers’ organizations, women’s groups and community-based 
organizations that applied improved organization-level management practices with USG 
assistance 
● Percentage of female participants in USG-assisted programs designed to increase access 
to productive economic resources (assets, credit, income or employment) (GNDR-2) 
● Percentage of youth, disabled and other disadvantaged group participants in USG-
assisted programs designed to increase access to productive economic resources (assets, 
credit, income or employment) 
● Number of microenterprises supported by USG assistance (EG.5-3) 



● Number of SMEs supported by USG assistance 
● Financial capital provided by intermediaries to TOF MSMEs supported by USG 
assistance 
● Amount of investment mobilized (in USD) for sustainable landscapes as supported by 
USG assistance (EG.13-4) [disaggregated Public / Private?] 
● Number of laws, policies, regulations, or standards addressing sustainable landscapes 
formally proposed, adopted, or implemented as supported by USG assistance (EG.13-3) 


 

A mid-term and final evaluation will be conducted by a third party at the end of the program as 
per USAID guidelines. The evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the activity and the 
results achieved against the objectives proposed in the activity. Lessons learned, challenges, and 
recommendations will be summarized by the third party for review by USAID/India. 

 

USAID/India recognizes that development efforts yield positive change more quickly if they are 
coordinated and collaborative, test promising new approaches in a continuous search for 
improvement, and build on what works, while eliminating what does not. The recipient must 
therefore implement a Collaboration, Learning and Adaptation (CLA) approach to continuously 
assess the activity’s causal pathways, target outcomes, and adjust the interventions and 
approach as necessary to yield the most effective course of action. The CLA Plan must clearly 
relate to the MEL Plan. 

B.3 Anticipated Start Date and Period of Performance for Federal Awards 

The anticipated period of performance is five (5) years. The estimated start date will be upon 
the signature of the award, on or about August 11, 2021. 

B.4 Substantial Involvement 10 

10 This Substantial Involvement section is subject to change following the Co-Creation Workshop and submission 
of the Final Application of Phase 3 

 

In accordance with ADS 303.3.11, USAID will remain substantially involved over the life of 
the Cooperative Agreement to assist the Recipient in achieving the expected outcomes and 
results of the program. Some examples of potential areas of substantial involvement during 
performance include the following: 

● Approval of recipient's implementation plans during performance; 
● Approval of key recipient personnel; and 
● Joint participation will be necessary to ensure achievement of key objectives during the 
performance of the activity. 


B.5 Authorized Geographic Code 

 

The authorized geographic code for the procurement of services and commodities is 937. Code 


937 is defined as the United States, the recipient country (India), and developing countries, 

but excluding any country that is a prohibited source. There are currently no prohibited source 

countries, but the list is updated regularly and can be found here: 
http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/310mac.pdf 

 

B.6 Nature of the Relationship between USAID and the Recipient 

The principal purpose of the relationship with the Recipient and under the subject program is to 
transfer funds to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation of the TOFI which is 
authorized by Federal statute. The successful Recipient will be responsible for ensuring the 
achievement of the program objectives and the efficient and effective administration of the 
award through the application of sound management practices. The Recipient will assume 
responsibility for administering Federal funds in a manner consistent with underlying 
agreements, program objectives, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

SECTION C: ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION 

C.1. Eligible Applicants 

This funding opportunity is unrestricted and open to all eligible U.S and non-U.S. non-
governmental organizations (other than those from foreign policy restricted countries), 
including foundations, institutions of higher education, consortiums and public international 
organizations, etc. Individuals are not eligible to participate. 

Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.400(g), it is USAID policy not to award profit under assistance 
instruments such as Cooperative Agreements. While for-profit firms may participate, pursuant 
to 2 CFR 700.13(A)1), Prohibition against Profit, no profit will be paid to any for-profit entity 
receiving or administering Federal financial assistance as a recipient or sub-recipient. 

USAID welcomes organizations that have not previously received financial assistance from 
USAID to submit their applications. 

Applicants must also provide a valid DUNS number in the SF-424 form to be submitted along 
with their application. Though not required during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 application process, 
the “Apparently Successful Applicant” (ASA) must have successfully registered in SAM 
(System for Award Management) prior to award. For those who have previously registered in 
SAM, they must renew and maintain an active SAM registration during the time they have 
concept notes or applications under consideration by a Federal awarding agency, or during an 
active Federal award. 

C.2 Cost Share or Leverage 

Under this NOFO there is not a mandatory cost share requirement. However, 25% of leverage 
from other sources of funding to implement activities is required. 

C.3 Other 

It is preferred that an organization only submits one concept paper as a prime or consortium 
leader under the NOFO. However, organizations participating as a member of a consortium 
may elect to participate in another consortium under a different concept paper as a prime 
recipient. 

C.4 Pre-award Survey / Risk Assessment 

The ASA has to be responsible for ensuring achievement of the objectives described in the 
NOFO. Therefore, the AO will decide on whether to subject the ASA to a pre-award survey, 
and based on the results, will make a determination if the prospective recipient is a responsible 
entity, i.e., whether it has the necessary organization, experience, adequate accounting and 
operational controls, and technical skills—or ability to obtain them—in order to achieve the 
objectives of the project and comply with the terms and conditions of the award. The AO must 
make a positive “risk assessment to ensure that the (ASA possesses the necessary management 
and technical competence to implement the proposed program. The ASA must agree to 


practice mutually agreed-upon methods of accountability for funds and other assets provided or 
funded by USAID. In the absence of a positive risk assessment, an award can ordinarily not be 
made. However, in rare cases, an award can be made with “Specific Conditions” (e.g., 
additional non-standard award requirements designed to minimize the risk presented to USAID 
of making an award to an organization for which a positive risk assessment cannot be made), 
but only where it appears likely that the applicant can correct the deficiency within a 
reasonable period. 

Please note that a pre-award survey does not commit USAID to make any award.

It is highly recommended that applicants read the entire NOFO before submitting an 
application. Respond to Merit Review criteria as appropriate and comply with all aspects of the 
NOFO. Failure to do so will be at the Applicant’s risk. 

D.5 Overall Selection Process 

The purpose of having three Merit Review phases is to identify an Applicant that will have the 
greatest chance of success to achieve the activity objectives. 

 

Below is the process diagram for this NOFO. 

 

 


Merit Review Phase 1 - Concept Paper: Applicants will be invited to submit a Concept Paper 
not to exceed ten pages, including a notional budget estimate. Information regarding the 
Concept Paper submission is in SECTION D.6 of this NOFO. 

 

Phase 1 is the submission and review of a written concept paper. Concept Papers will be 
reviewed for technical soundness, organizational and management approach and the 
applicant’s institutional capability and past experience. The highest rated concept paper 
applicants will be invited to participate in Phase 2. 

 

In the event USAID determines that none of submitted Concept Papers are acceptable, 

USAID will issue an amendment to the Addendum to seek a second round of interested 

applicants. 

 

Merit Review Phase 2 - Oral Presentation: Selected Applicants will be invited to orally 
present their concepts through videoconference to be held approximately two (2) weeks after 
being notified that their concept paper was accepted for Phase 2. This oral presentation is a 
requirement. The format, technical requirements, and videoconference information will be 
made available to those Applicants invited to participate in the oral presentations. The 
Applicant’s concept paper author/s and lead technical backstops must be part of the 
presentation team. 


USAID will not be responsible for costs associated with presentation. 

One or two applicants will be selected from the Merit Review Phase 2 as the Apparently 
Successful Applicant (ASA)11. The ASA will be notified by letter approximately two (2) 
weeks after completion of oral presentations. The ASA will be invited to participate in Phase 3. 

11 Apparently Successful Applicant(s). The applicant for USAID funding recommended for an award after the 
merit review, but who has not yet been awarded cooperative agreement by the Agreement Officer. Apparently 
successful applicant status confers no right and constitutes no USAID commitment to an award, which still must 
be obligated by the Agreement Officer 

At the completion of Phase 2, the competitive process of ADS 303 will be satisfied. 

Phase 3 - Application co-creation and Merit Review of the final proposal: Approximately 
one (1) week after phase 2, ASA will receive a notification for a week long collaborative 
workshop to be hosted by USAID/India via video conference to develop a program description 
and subsequently submit a full technical and cost application. Participants in this workshop 
will include the ASA, USAID, and potentially other stakeholders such as MoEFCC and will 
bring together the various technical approaches and innovations of the applicant and further 
define activities. 

Programmatic budget levels, as well as sources and modalities for leveraging additional funds 
to finance activities under Program Description, will also be finalized during this phase. The 
goal is that after the one-week workshop, a programmatic framework will be in place which 
clearly illustrates how the ASA will implement the proposed strategies to achieve the goals and 
objectives stated in the NOFO. After the workshop, ASA will continue to work remotely to 
refine its approach and will draft a robust program description and detailed cost application to 
be submitted within one (1) week. USAID will review these two documents and provide 
additional clarification questions within one (1) week, if any. Additional information regarding 
the logistics and content of the workshop will be provided as part of the ASA Notification 
Letter. Based on the results of the final review, USAID will determine the Apparently 
Successful Applicant (ASA). 

USAID reserves the right to ask two or more applicants to work collaboratively on a program 
description and cost application if, in USAID’s opinion, combining their concepts will result in 
a more effective overall program. 

No funding will be made available prior to the award of the Cooperative Agreement. 
Applicants, including the organization selected to collaboratively develop the Program 
Description, are responsible for all costs related to the oral presentation phase and Program 
Description Development Workshop. Once the award is signed, the implementing partner may 
start incurring costs. Applicants not selected for the consecutive phase will be notified at the 
end of each phase. Unsuccessful applicants may request additional information following such 
notification. 

D.6 Content and Form of Application Submission 

(a) Phase 1 – Concept Paper Content and Format: 


 

The initial application should be written from a comprehensive viewpoint that shows 
innovations and approaches proposed by the Applicant and lays out how the Applicant is 
uniquely capable of achieving the objectives and results set forth in Section A. 

 

The initial application or the “concept paper” must demonstrate an understanding of the 
activity and introduce the applicant’s strategy and methodology, including its strategic 
approach and realistic yet innovative interventions. 

Applicants must format their Concept Papers as follows: 

● Spacing: Singled-spaced; 
● Font: Times New Roman, 12 points; 
● Margins: one-inch margins on all sides; 
● Paper Size: 8.5 inches x 11 inches; 
● any graphs, charts, exhibits, tables, etc. contained in the body of the concept paper shall 
be numbered and included in the stated page limits (see below). Table font may be 
reduced to Times New Roman, 10-point. 


Concept Papers should be no more than 10 pages, exclusive of cover page, table of contents 
and annexes. They must be presented taking into account and in the order of the technical 
evaluation criteria found in Section E.2: 

● Cover Page (1 page; not included in the page count) and must contain— 


❖ Project Title 

❖ Notice of Funding Opportunity number 

❖ Name, address and telephone number of the Organization (primary or lead) 

❖ Proposed sub-awardees or partners

❖ Proposed Notional Budget - estimated cost summary, direct, and indirect costs by 

the applicant and sub-awardees/partners (not to exceed one page) 

 

● Technical Approach (7 pages; included in the page count) – 

In this section, the Applicant should present its overall vision for the NOFO stated goal and 


objectives and explain how the Applicant and its sub-awardees/partners can support the 
vision. Since the Applicant will collaboratively develop the final program description with 
USAID, it is not necessary to present a full or detailed technical application addressing 
every aspect of the priority areas listed under the activity objective. The Applicant will use 
the technical general approach to demonstrate an understanding of the role of trees outside 
forests in enhancing ecosystem services and inclusive economic development in India, the 
GOI priorities regarding trees outside forests, the challenges for the uptake of trees outside 
forest, the key stakeholders and the opportunities to increase uptake of trees outside forests. 

 

Applicants must focus on describing how they propose to achieve the objectives and 
elaborate on how the proposed technical approach is the most effective way to address the 
intent of the NOFO. At a minimum, this section must contain: 

a. Summary Statement: A brief statement of the problem(s)/issue(s) being addressed, 

and proposed strategies/activities. 

b. Timeline: Proposed timeline, i.e. project duration or time needed to complete the 

proposed activities. This project duration should not exceed 5 years. 

c. Includes vision statement, brief narratives describing the 

situational context and background (limited to what is necessary to understand the 

project), the problem to be addressed, approach to achieving the project objectives and 
results. 

 Also include in the project description a brief discussion regarding: 

d. Sustainability (how the project will be supported and can continue without donor funding) 
and self-reliance; 

e. succinct description of gender integration opportunities identified. 

f. Collaboration with the GOI and other key stakeholders; 

g. Plan for leveraging funds and private sector engagement in helping achieve the objectives 
of the activity. 

h. List of tentative indicators and targets (a maximum of 5) that would be crucial for 
achieving the project objectives. 

 

● Organizational Management and Staffing Plan (2 pages; included in the page count) 


This Project will require specialized skills from multiple sets of partners USAID/India does not 
expect one organization to have all of the professional skills, services, and knowledge base 
required to meet the results; it is for this reason that subawards/partnerships are encouraged. 
USAID/India encourages the Applicant to clearly describe the individual skills and capacity of 
each partner organization, define the value each partner brings, and how they complement one 
another. Sub awards/partnerships with local entities 12will be critical in achieving the results of 
the program. 

12 As defined in ADS 303.6 Local Entity (b) 

 

The Applicant should succinctly outline an inclusive leadership approach that will create a 

shared common vision and purpose that builds trust and recognizes the value and 

contribution of all sub-awardees/partners. The Applicant is required to coordinate with USAID 
and relevant GOI ministries and agencies. 

 


• Institutional Capability and Past Performance (1 page; included in the page count) 

 

USAID/India understands that achievement of desired outcomes relies on the overall 
performance of an organization. For this reason, USAID/India will evaluate both the Applicant. 
Not only will technical capacity be examined, but also the ability of each sub-awardee/partner 
organization to work with each other, focused on a common purpose. Past performance 
information must be provided and should relate to the specific technical nature of the Activity. 
The Applicant must provide performance information for each organization member (as an 
Annex; no longer than one page per organization). The Applicant is strongly encouraged to 
provide specific examples of significant impact of their past projects and how cooperation in 
prior partnerships/consortia contributed to that impact. 

 

USAID will determine the relevance (complexity, scope, size and magnitude) of 

similar performance information as a predictor of probable performance under the subject 

requirement. USAID will consider relevant projects successfully performed during the 

recent 3 to 5 years to be “recent performance information”. 

 

The Applicant should address the following points: 

● Demonstrated successful experience in managing and implementing similar 

programs, in size and scale, preferably in South and South East Asia; 

● Timeliness of performance, cost, and scope; and 

● How the Headquarters management team contributed to success, if applicable. 

 

 

(b) Phase 2 – Oral Presentation Instructions 

 

Based on USAID’s merit review of Concept Papers, only Applicants whose concept papers are 

the highest rated, i.e., are determined to meet the criteria, will be invited to present their 
concept papers via video conferencing. The order of presentation among the selected 
Applicants will be randomly determined by the Agreement Officer. 

 

Applicants who will be invited to the Oral Presentations will be notified promptly as to the date 
of their scheduled presentation. They should expect at least two (2) weeks notice before their 
scheduled oral presentation. At the time of the invitation, USAID will provide the initial 
discussion items based on the review of Concept Papers. 

 

Oral Presentations are a condition of award as technical discussions will also occur at this 
stage. Video conference information will be provided prior to the scheduled date. 

 

The audience for the Oral Presentation will consist of the Selection Committee (SC), the 
Agreement Officer. The Agreement Officer will chair the Oral Presentations. While the 
Concept Paper will be presented in PowerPoint format, the remaining discussions will be in 
Question and Answer (Q&A) format with some time for consultation among members of the 
presenting team. Each team member should be an expert and should use the PowerPoint to 
present the salient/important points of the Concept Paper without reading the slide contents 


verbatim to the audience. Team member must be able to “think on their feet” and to actively 
participate in the discussion of subsequent Q’s & A’s. 

 

The Oral Presentation Agenda will be shared with the applicants who reach phase 2. Each oral 
presentation will be evaluated and scored by the SC in accordance with the merit review 
criteria set forth under Section E.3 of this NOFO. In the presentation, the applicant should 
summarize their concept note while also addressing the questions raised by USAID on 
technical approach, organizational management and staffing, and the MEL approach. The 
presentation should also give an expanded list of indicators and targets (in addition to the five 
provided in the concept stage) which are significant in achieving the activity results. 

 

Applicant Participants 

 

The Applicant’s concept paper author/s and lead technical backstops must be part of the 

presentation team. Selected Applicant is also highly encouraged to include participants from 
proposed sub partner organizations (if applicable). Selected Applicants are limited to five 
participants and must be present via video conference on the date and time specified for the 
presentation (provided in the invitation notification letter. 

 

Notification 

 

Upon completion of the oral presentations, USAID plans to inform the highest rated 
Applicant/s if its application has been selected to proceed to the next stage of the review 
process. For the selected applicant(s), USAID will provide a written summary (feedback) of 
their Oral Presentation/Discussion to further guide the co-creation workshop preparation. 
Unsuccessful Applicants will have the opportunity to request additional information following 
a notification that they were not selected to proceed to the next phase. 

 

USAID reserves the right to select another applicant from the pool of Selected Applicants in 
phase-2 in case final agreement is not reached with the initially selected ASA in phase-3. 

 

(c) Phase 3 - Co-design: Program Description Design Workshop Instructions 

 

The highly rated Applicant/s will develop the Program Description for the resulting 
Cooperative Agreement in collaboration with USAID/India. Approximately two weeks after 
the notification, a two-week collaborative workshop will be hosted by USAID/India. The 
workshop will be conducted through videoconferencing and other forms of remote 
communication. This workshop, participants will include the highly rated applicant/s, USAID, 
and potentially other stakeholders, will bring together the selected technical approach to further 
define program activities. The highly rated applicant/s will make a determination as to who 
will be the appropriate representatives from its team/consortium. Other stakeholder inclusion in 
the workshop will be determined by USAID on a later date (but before the workshop dates), 
and likely set forth in the Notification Letter for Phase-3. 

The Program Description should include, at a minimum, expanded information on the 
Applicant’s Technical Approach and Organizational Management and Staffing. In addition, the 


Program Description will articulate its strategies in implementing its Monitoring, Evaluation 
and Learning Methodology that will facilitate adapting learning and management. The 
Applicant must also demonstrate how it will apply adaptive management techniques to inform 
program management and key decisions. If construction of nurseries is included in this award 
then it will be in accordance with ADS 303.3.30 Limitation on Construction under Assistance. 

A highly rated applicant which may be the ASA should also anticipate commencing budget 
formulation during this workshop, once a programmatic framework is in place, which clearly 
illustrates how the ASA will tackle the activity objectives. Additional logistics and content of 
the workshop will be provided as part of the ASA Notification Letter. 

 

Phase 3 – Technical and Cost/Business Application 

 

Upon completion of the PD Design Workshop, the ASA will be notified to submit a Final 
Technical and Cost/Business Application. Only electronic submission via email to the Agency 
Point of Contact at indiarco@usaid.gov with a copy to vvats@usaid.gov 

(1) Technical Application Instruction 

 

The ASA will develop its Technical Application, which will be the Program Description of the 
resulting Cooperative Agreement in collaboration with USAID. The Technical Application is 
the most important part of consideration in making the award decision. It must demonstrate the 
Applicant’s capabilities and expertise with respect to achieving the goals of this activity. It 
must be specific, complete and presented concisely. The technical applications should not be 
more than 45 pages. 

Detailed format and content of the Full Technical Application will be developed in 
collaboration between the ASA and USAID. 

 

The Technical Application will include the Program Description co-created and finalized 
during the PD Design Workshop.

Application) and other pertinent staff (management and technical personnel) named in 
the Organizational Chart 
● Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Plan 
● Draft Branding Strategy and Marking Plan 
● Environmental and climate risk mitigation 


 

(2) Cost/Business Application Instruction 

 


The Cost/Business Application must be submitted separately from the Technical Application. 
The Applicant shall submit a budget broken down by program years and in detailed costs for 
implementation of the program including the subrecipient's cost. The excel sheet should 
include a summary budget. The budget breakdown must be presented in an unlocked Microsoft 
Excel (version 2000 or later) spreadsheet with no hidden nor locked cells/sheets. The budget 
breakdown must be accompanied by a budget narrative which provides in detail the 
assumptions made for each of the cost elements. The application must provide evidence that 
the funds requested are reasonable and would be used in a cost-effective manner. 

 

The Cost/Business Application must contain the following:

Detailed breakdown should include the following: 

 

• Personnel – Must be proposed consistent with 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation - 
Personal Services. Direct salaries, wages and allowances must ’include position 
title, salary rate, level of effort, and salary escalation factors. Specify the budget for 
the portion of the Activity to be passed through to any subrecipients. See 2 CFR 
200.330 for assistance in determining whether the sub-tier entity is a subrecipient or 
contractor. The subrecipient budgets must align with the same requirements as the 
Applicant’s budget, including those related to fringe and indirect costs. The name, 
daily and annual salary, expected level of effort of each person charged to the 
program; same information should be provided for Consultants. 


 

• Fringe Benefits – (if applicable) If the Applicant has a fringe benefit rate approved 
by an agency of the U.S. Government, the Applicant must use such rate and provide 
evidence of its approval. If an Applicant does not have a fringe benefit rate 
approved, the Applicant must propose a rate and explain how the Applicant 
determined the rate. In this case, the Budget Narrative must include a detailed 
breakdown of all items of fringe benefits (e.g., superannuation, gratuity, etc.) and 
the costs of each, expressed in U.S. dollars and as a percentage of salaries. 


 

• Allowances: Allowances must be broken down by specific type and by person and 
must be in accordance with the Applicant’s policies. All salaries, benefits and 
allowances must be based on written compensation policies of the organization. 
Allowances should be in accordance with the applicant’s policies and the applicable 
regulations and policies. Explain assumptions in the Budget Narrative. If the 
organization has standing policies across all projects for annual salary escalations 
that exceed current inflation rates, those policies and the effective date of those 
policies must be provided with the application. The Applicant must also confirm 
that the policy applies to all staff across all projects. 


 

• Travel and Transportation: Travel, per diem and other transportation expenses must 
be detailed in the financial plan to include the number of international trips, from

cost estimates). 


 

• Equipment: Detail all equipment to be purchased, including the type of equipment, 
the manufacturer, the unit cost, the number of units to be purchased and the 
expected geographic source. The Budget Narrative must include the purpose of the 
equipment and supplies and the basis for the estimates. 


 

• Supplies: Detail all materials and supplies expected to be purchased, including type, 
unit cost, and number of units. The budget narrative must include the purpose of 
supplies and the basis for the estimates. 



 

• Contractual: Detail of all contractual, sub-recipients and sub-grants. Separate 
budget breakdown (using the same line item breakdown of the prime Applicant) for 
each sub-recipient/sub-award 


 

• Construction: Detail of all construction costs related to nurseries. 


 

• Indirect cost: must be supported with information (i.e., Negotiated Indirect Cost 
Rate 


 Agreement) to substantiate the calculation of the indirect cost. 

 

• Other Direct Cost: This may include other costs not elsewhere specified, such as 
report preparation costs, passports and visas fees, medical exams and inoculations, 
as well as any other miscellaneous costs which directly benefit the Activity 
proposed by the applicant. The applicant should indicate the subject, venue and 
duration of any proposed conferences and seminars, and their relationship to the 
objectives of the Activity, along with estimates of costs. Otherwise, the narrative 
should be minimal. 


 

• For commercial organizations, no profit or fee shall be included in the budget. All 
reasonable and allowable expenses, both direct and indirect, which are related to the 
program and are in accordance with applicable cost principles under 2 CFR 200 and 
2 CFR 700 


 

(iv) Budget Narrative 

 

The budget narrative should explain all budget assumptions and how the costs are derived. It 
will provide information regarding the basis of estimates for each line item, including 
reference to source used to estimate the costs (i.e., organization’s policy, payroll document, 
vendor quotes, etc.) 

 

(v) Other administrative documentation 

 

a. Evidence of responsibility 

 

The Agreement Officer requires from the Applicant certain documents to be submitted in order 
to determine the Applicant’s responsibility as well as to assess USAID’s risk should an award 
be made. The information submitted shall substantiate that the Applicant: 

 

• Has adequate financial, management and personnel resources and systems or the ability to 
obtain such resources as required during the performance of the award; 
• Has the ability to comply with the award conditions, taking into account all existing and 
currently prospective commitments of the Applicant, non-governmental and 
governmental; 
• Has a satisfactory record of performance. Past relevant unsatisfactory performance is 
ordinarily sufficient to justify a finding of non-responsibility, unless there is clear 



evidence of subsequent satisfactory performance; 
• Has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; and 
• Is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive a cooperative agreement under applicable 
laws and regulations. 


 

b. Indirect cost rate justification 

 

A copy of the Applicant organization’s current Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement 
(NICRA), if it has one with a U.S. Federal Agency. Applicant and proposed sub-
awardee(s)/partner(s) that do not currently have a NICRA from their cognizant agency 
(USAID or another U.S. Federal Agency) must also submit copies of the partners’ financial 
reports for the previous 3-year period, which have been audited by a certified public accountant 
or other auditor satisfactory to USAID. 

 

● Reviewed financial statements that provide the user with comfort that, based on the 
accountant’s review, the accountant is not aware of any material modifications that 
should be made to the financial statements for the statements to be in conformity with the 
applicable financial reporting framework. During a review engagement, the Accountant 
obtains limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to 
the financial statements. Therefore, the objective of a review of the financial statements 
is to obtain limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made 
to the financial statements. A review does not contemplate obtaining an understanding of 
the entity’s internal control; assessing fraud risk; testing accounting records; or other 
procedures ordinarily performed in an audit. The CPA issues a report stating the review 
was performed in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review 
Services; that management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and 
for designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation. 


 

● Audited financial statements that provide the user with the auditor’s opinion that the 
financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the 
applicable financial reporting framework. In an audit, the auditor is required by auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) to obtain an 
understanding of the entity’s internal control and assess fraud risk. The auditor also 
corroborates the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements by 
obtaining audit evidence through inquiry, physical inspection, observation, third-party 
confirmations, examination, analytical procedures and other procedures. The auditor 
issues a report that states that the audit was conducted in accordance with GAAS, the 
financial statements are the responsibility of management, provides an opinion that the 
financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the 
company and the results of operations are in conformity with the applicable financial 
reporting framework (or issues a qualified opinion if the financial statements are not in 
conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework. The auditor may also issue 
a disclaimer of opinion or an adverse opinion if appropriate). 


 

Applicants that have not received a grant, cooperative agreement or contract from the U.S. 


Government are required to submit a copy of their accounting manual. 

 

c. Proof of Business Registration to conduct business in India 

 

d. The applicant must complete the following documents and submit a signed copy with 
their application: 

 

 

(1) “Certifications, Assurances, Representations, and Other Statements of the Recipient” 
document found at https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/303mav.pdf. 

 

((2) Assurances for Non-Construction Programs (SF-424B) 

 

(3) Certificate of Compliance: Please submit a copy of your Certificate of 

 Compliance if your organization’s systems have been certified by 

 USAID/Washington’s Office of Acquisition and Assistance (M/OAA). 

 

d. Proof of Duns and SAM registration. 

 

USAID may not award to an Applicant until the Applicant has complied with all applicable 
unique entity identifier and System for Award Management (SAM) requirements. The 
Applicant is required to: 

 

● Be registered in SAM before submitting its full application 
● Provide valid unique identifier (DUNS number) in its application; and, 
● Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during 
which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a 
Federal awarding agency. 


 

The registration process may take several weeks to complete. Therefore, Applicants are 
encouraged to obtain them early to be eligible for an award under this NOFO. 

 

DUNS number: http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform 

SAM registration: http://www.sam.gov 

 

Completion of an early registration does not constitute any commitment on the part of the U.S. 
Government to make an award. 

 

e. Consortium arrangements 

 

If the Applicant has established a consortium or another legal relationship among its partners, 
the Cost/Business application must include a copy of the legal relationship between the parties. 
The agreement should include a full discussion of the relationship between the Applicant and 
Sub-Applicant(s) including identification of the Applicant with whom USAID will work with 
for purposes of Agreement administration, identity of the Applicant which will have accounting 


responsibility, how Agreement effort will be allocated and the express agreement of the 
principals thereto to be held jointly and severely liable for the acts or omissions of the other. 

 

f. Negotiation 

 

Upon consideration of award or during the negotiations leading to an award, Applicants may 
be required to submit additional documentation deemed necessary for the Agreement Officer to 
make an affirmative determination of responsibility. Applicants should not submit the 
information below with their applications! The information in this section is provided so that 
Applicant may become familiar with additional documentation that may be requested by the 
Agreement Officer: 

● Bylaws, constitution, and articles of incorporation, if applicable. 
● Whether the organizational travel, procurement, financial management, accounting 
manual and personnel policies and procedures, especially regarding salary, 
promotion, leave, differentials, etc., submitted under this section have been 
reviewed and approved by any agency of the Federal Government, and if so, 
provide the name, address, and phone number of the cognizant reviewing official. 
The Applicant should provide copies of the same.

SECTION E: APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION 

E.1 Criteria 

All applications will be reviewed in accordance with the review criteria set forth below. The 
purpose of the merit process is to identify an Applicant with the best approach to achieve the 
Trees Outside Forests in India Activity objectives and results, as described in Section A. 

 

The criteria presented below have been tailored to the requirements of this NOFO. Applicants 
should note that these criteria serve to: (a) identify the significant matters that Applicants 
should address in their applications, and (b) set the standards against which applications will be 
evaluated. 

 

The criteria listed below are presented so that Applicants will know which areas require 
emphasis in the preparation of their applications during the appropriate phase. 

E.2 Review and selection Process 

Phase 1 – Concept Paper 

The Initial concept paper should be written from a comprehensive viewpoint that shows 
innovations and approaches proposed by the Applicant and lays out how the Applicant is 
uniquely capable of achieving the objectives and results set forth in Section A. See also Section 
D5(a). 

 

The Initial Application will be reviewed based on the following merit criteria. The criteria 
listed below are presented in order of importance – Factor 1 is the most important factor, and 
Factor 2 is more important than Factor 3. 

 

(a) Factor 1 - Technical Approach 

 

Applicants will be evaluated on: 

 

● The extent to which the Applicant clearly articulates its innovative and feasible 
technical approach for each of the core areas set forth in section A and convincingly 
demonstrates the rationale of how it will achieve the desired objectives/results of the 
USAID Trees Outside Forest in India Activity, including the indicators and proposed 
targets. 
● The extent to which the applicant demonstrates a sound plan for leveraging funds and 
private sector engagement in helping achieve the objectives. 
● The extent to which the Applicant clearly demonstrates how it will engage with GOI 
ministries and agencies, state level agencies, the private sector and other relevant 
stakeholders, and how its approach will maintain the sustainability of the activity 
results. 


 

 

(b) Factor 2- Organizational Management and Staffing 


 

Applicants will be evaluated on the extent to which the Applicant’s well-articulated 
management plan and staffing plan demonstrate the Applicant will effectively and efficiently 
achieve the activity objectives and results.The applicant will also be evaluated based on clarity 
on roles and responsibilities of sub-partners and skills of key personnel. 

 

 

(c) Factor 3 - Institutional Capability and Past Performance 

 

Applicants will be evaluated on the degree to which the Applicant convincingly demonstrates 
through its past experience that it possesses the institutional capacity to successfully 
implement the proposed intervention to achieve the project objectives and results. 

 

Institutional capacity and past performance records for both Applicant and its proposed sub-
awardees/partners will be closely reviewed and evaluated for their relevance and performance 
experience on similar projects performed within the last 3-5 years. Relevance is defined as 
projects performed of a similar scope, magnitude and scale. The Applicant and its partners 
have the technical and management experience and skills to implement the proposed 
interventions. 

 

Performance information will be used for responsibility determination. USAID may use 
performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the Applicant. 
USAID will utilize existing databases of agreements performance information if any and 
solicit additional information from the references provided in and from other sources if and 
when the Agreement Officer finds the existing databases to be insufficient for evaluating an 
applicant’s performance. 

 

In cases where an Applicant lacks relevant past performance history or in which information 
on past performance is not available, the Applicant will not be evaluated favorably or 
unfavorably on past performance. In such cases the Applicant will be rated “neutral”. The 
“neutral” rating provided to these applicants is at the Agreement Officer's discretion based on 
the past performance ratings for all other applicants. Prior to assigning a "neutral" past 
performance rating, the Agreement Officer may take into account a broad range of 
information related to an applicant’s past performance. 

E.3 Phase 2 – Oral Presentation 

The applicant will be evaluated based on how effectively the applicant responds to the 
questions and clarifications raised by USAID on the technical approach, organizational 
management and staffing, the MEL approach, and the level of ambition in establishing realistic 
and achievable indicators and targets to achieve the project results. 

 

 

 

 


E.4 Phase 3 – Co-Creation 

Only those who succeed from the Phase 2 Merit Review will be invited to join the co-creation 
phase which will result in the submission of Full Technical and Cost/Business 

Applications for final evaluation. USAID reserves the right to select another Applicant from 

the pool of Phase 2 merit review participants in case final agreement is not reached with the 

initially selected Applicant reaching phase-3. 

E.5 Final Technical Application/Program Description 

There will be no evaluation factors during Phase 3 (Program Description Design Workshop) 
but the resulting Program Description developed during the workshop will be the final 
technical application which will be incorporated into the resulting Cooperative Agreement. The 
final technical application/program description is the most important part of consideration in 
making the award decision. 

 

At this stage, USAID/India will evaluate the Final Technical Application of the ASA as 
“Acceptable” or “Unacceptable”. In the event that negotiations fail to improve the ASA’s final 
technical application/program description, the Agreement Officer may determine the 
application as “Unacceptable”. 

E.6 Cost/Business Review 

During the Collaboration Workshop, USAID/India and the ASA will commence negotiation 
regarding the anticipated costs associated with implementing the Program Description. 
Following the Workshop, the ASA will finalize a Cost/Business Application based upon the 
discussions. 

 

The Cost/Business Application will be reviewed separately from the Technical Application. 
Although Cost/Business Application will not be rated, the Applicant should have a structure 
that will allow it to provide the greatest value (highest result) at a reasonable cost. 

 

The Agency will evaluate the cost/business application of the applicant(s) under consideration 
for an award as a result of the merit criteria review to determine whether the costs are 
allowable in accordance with the cost principles found in 2 CFR 200 Subpart E and to ensure 
that all compliance requirements have been satisfied and the Agreement Officer can make an 
affirmative determination of responsibility. 

 

Cost will be reviewed for general completeness, reasonableness, allowability and allocability. 
Cost realism is an assessment of the accuracy with the proposed costs and represents the most 
probable cost of performance within the Applicant’s technical and management approach. Cost 
realism review will be performed as part of the review process to: 

(i) verify the Applicant’s understanding of the activity objective; 

(ii) assess the degree to which the cost application reflects the approaches and/or risk 
assessments made in the technical application as well as the risk that the Applicant will provide 
the supplies or services for the offered cost; and 


(iii) assess the degree to which the cost included in the cost application accurately represents 
the work effort included in the technical application. 

 

The AO will perform a risk assessment (2 CFR 200.206). The AO may determine that a pre-
award survey is required to inform the risk assessment in determining whether the prospective 
recipient has the necessary organizational, experience, accounting and operational controls, 
financial resources, and technical skills – or ability to obtain them – in order to achieve the 
objectives of the program and comply with the terms and conditions of the award. Depending 
on the result of the risk assessment, the AO will decide to execute the award, not execute the 
award, or award with “specific conditions” (2 CFR 200.208).

SECTION F: FEDERAL AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION 

F.1 Federal Award Notices 

The notice of award will be provided electronically to the successful applicant’s point of 
contact listed in the application. Notification will also be made electronically to unsuccessful 
applicants pursuant to ADS 303.3.7.1.b. For the successful application, USAID may reach out 
to the applicant with clarifying questions and a request for a revised application by a specified 
date. USAID reserves the right to award without requesting clarifications or additional detail 
on an application. 

 

Award of the agreement contemplated by this NOFO cannot be made until funds have 

been appropriated, allocated and committed through internal USAID procedures. While 
USAID anticipates that these procedures will be successfully completed, potential applicants 
are hereby notified of these requirements and conditions for the award. The Agreement Officer 
is the only individual who may legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public 
funds. No costs chargeable to the proposed Agreement may be incurred before receipt of either 
a fully executed Agreement or a specific, written authorization from the Agreement Officer. 

 

Applicants are advised that costs incurred prior to receipt of either a fully executed Agreement 
(in electronic or print form) or a specific, written authorization from the Agreement Officer are 
not allowable and therefore are ineligible for reimbursement under the Agreement. The 
Agreement Officer will also provide written notification electronically to the unsuccessful 
Applicants’ Points of Contact. Requests for additional information from unsuccessful Applicants 
will not be considered. 

 

F.2 Administrative & National Policy Requirements 

The resulting cooperative agreement will be administered in accordance with the following 
policies and regulations. :

USAID funding that may be provided) and used for program purposes. 

F.5 Environmental Compliance 

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, Section 117 requires that the impact of 
USAID’s activities on the environment be considered and that USAID include environmental 
sustainability as a central consideration in designing and carrying out its development 
programs. This mandate is codified in Federal Regulations (22 CFR 216) and in USAID’s 
Automated Directives System (ADS) Parts 201.5.10g and 204 
(http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/200/), which, in part, require that the potential environmental 
impacts of USAID-financed activities are identified prior to a final decision to proceed and that 
appropriate environmental safeguards are adopted for all activities. 

 

1a) Respondent environmental compliance obligations under these regulations and procedures 
are specified in the following paragraphs of this Notice of Funding Opportunity. 

 

1b) In addition, the recipient must comply with host country environmental regulations unless 
otherwise directed in writing by USAID. In case of conflict between host country and USAID 
regulations, the latter shall govern. 


 

1c) No activity funded under this award will be implemented unless an environmental 
threshold determination, as defined by 22 CFR 216, has been reached for that activity, as 
documented in a Request for Categorical Exclusion (RCE), Initial Environmental Examination 
(IEE), or Environmental Assessment (EA) duly signed by the Bureau Environmental Officer 
(BEO). (Hereinafter, such documents are described as “approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentation.”) 

 

An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) will be prepared and approved during the co-
design and selection of various components for this activity. Prior to award, USAID will 
approve the IEE and also make it publicly available in the USAIS’s environmental compliance 
database. The IEE will cover activities expected to be implemented under this award. The 
recipient shall be responsible for implementing all IEE conditions pertaining to activities to be 
funded after the award. 

 

2a) As part of its initial Work Plan, and all Annual Work Plans thereafter, the recipient, in 
collaboration with the USAID Cognizant Technical Officer and Mission Environmental 
Officer or Bureau Environmental Officer, as appropriate, shall review all ongoing and planned 
activities under this award to determine if they are within the scope of the approved Regulation 
216 environmental documentation. 

 

2b) If the recipient plans any new activities outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentation, it shall prepare an amendment to the documentation for USAID 
review and approval. No such new activities shall be undertaken prior to receiving written 
USAID approval of environmental documentation amendments. 

 

2c) Any ongoing activities found to be outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentation shall be halted until an amendment to the documentation is 
submitted and written approval is received from USAID. 

 

 3) If the approved Regulation 216 documentation is (1) an IEE that contains one or more 
Negative Determinations with conditions and/or (2) an Environmental Assessment (EA), the 
recipient shall: 

 

3a) Unless the approved Regulation 216 documentation contains a complete environmental 
mitigation and monitoring plan (EMMP) or a project mitigation and monitoring (M&M) plan, 
the recipient shall prepare an EMMP or M&M Plan describing how the recipient will, in 
specific terms, implement all IEE and/or EA conditions that apply to proposed project

or Services (Effective Date: 08/18/2020 

Effective August 13, 2020, a recipient may not procure covered telecommunication equipment 
or services for the implementation of their program using award funds. 2 CFR 200.216, 
applicable to US organizations, and the standard provision “Prohibition on Certain 
Telecommunication and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment” applicable to non-US 
NGOs, implement Section 889(b) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act 
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 (Pub. L. 115-232) that prohibits the use of award funds, 
including direct and indirect costs, cost share and program income, to procure covered 
telecommunication and video surveillance services or equipment. The statute covers certain 
telecommunications equipment and services produced or provided by Huawei Technologies 
Company or ZTE Corporation, Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Hikvision 
Digital Technology Company, or Dahua Technology Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate 
of such entities).

protection of beneficiaries, provided that such items are manufactured locally or in the 
same geographical region as the country in which USAID is providing assistance, as 
defined by the U.S. Department of State’s regional system (Africa, East Asia and the 
Pacific, Europe and Eurasia, Near East, South and Central Asia, and Western 
Hemisphere), and provided that such items are not, and could not reasonably be 
expected to be, meant for the United States market. 


 

The [AO or CO] may change the exemptions set forth in this paragraph in writing; any such 
changes shall apply prospectively. 


3. “Staff” for the purposes of the Exception in 2(a) is defined as any individuals receiving 
financial compensation from the recipient or contractor or sub-recipient or subcontractor. 

4. For each purchase of Covered Material under Exception 2(b), the recipient or contractor 
must provide the AO/CO with contemporaneously dated documentation that the order of 
Covered Material is not meant for, and could not reasonably be meant for, the U.S. market. The 
AO/CO will then upload the statement into ASIST. This documentation can take the form of a 
simple email verification from a vendor or a brief, contemporaneously dated, written statement 
or e-mail from the recipient or contractor confirming its conversation with the vendor. 

F.8 Program Reporting 

The Recipient must submit a copy of each report required by this Agreement to the Agreement 
Officer, the AOR, and the Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC). Submission to the

The title page of all reports forwarded to USAID must include a descriptive title, the author's 
name, Cooperative Agreement number, the project number and title, the Recipient’s name, the 
name of the USAID office, and the publication or issuance date of the report. 

 

(1) Annual Implementation Plan 

 

The Recipient must work with USAID to develop and submit an initial annual implementation 
work plan within 45 calendar days of the effective date of the award. Subsequent annual 
implementation plans will be submitted within 30 days before the start of the succeeding fiscal 
year. The AOR will review and approve the plan within 15 calendar days after receipt of the 
draft implementation plan. 

 

The implementation plan must include, at a minimum: 

 

● Proposed accomplishments and expected progress towards achieving program results and 
performance measures tied to the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Plan 
● Timeline for implementation of the year’s proposed interventions, including target 
completion dates 
● Information on how interventions will be put in place 
● Gender Action Plan that will define how gender will be integrated in the activity cycle 
● Environmental Risk Mitigation Plan which will describe how environmental compliance 
and climate risk management will be integrated into activity interventions 
● Personnel requirements to achieve expected outcomes 
● Details of collaboration with other major partners 
● Annual budget with estimates of projected monthly expenditures 


 

(2) Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Plan 

 

The MEL Plan must describe the agreed upon framework of goals, outcomes, and outputs for 
the program, along with performance indicators, baselines and targets defined for each, and 


sex-disaggregated where appropriate. The MEL Plan must describe the evaluative work that 
the implementing partner will conduct for its own management decision-making, institutional 
learning, and accountability purposes (see ADS 203.3.1, as revised, for more detailed 
guidance). 

 

During the first sixty (60) days after the award is made, the Recipient will work closely with 
the USAID AOR to finalize its MEL Plan. The plan must identify specific indicators for 
measuring the following aspects of the recipient’s performance: 

 

● progress toward meeting program objectives and sub-objectives; 
● time frame for achieving these objectives and sub-objectives; 


 

The Recipient will collaborate with the USAID AOR to review/update its MEL Plan, and to 

monitor and report to USAID. 

 

Both quantitative and qualitative indicators need to be developed and special attention paid to 

data sources, collection methods, and data quality assessment. 

 

Program monitoring and evaluation comprises an essential component of this cooperative 

agreement for the following reasons: 

 

● informs USAID of progress; 
● enables detailed and on-going design of activities and sub-activities; 
● builds counterparts’ capacity to collect and analyze the data for sound decision-making; 
and 


 

At a minimum, the MEL Plan must include the following: 

 

▪ Automated and other methods used to gather, store, manipulate, summarize, analyze, 
and/or report performance data. 
▪ Procedures for regular communication with USAID regarding the status of monitoring 
activities, including a means for early notification of problems. 
▪ Means of addressing a discovered lack of progress or success. Procedures will focus on 
learning from mistakes, analyzing them, and ascertaining the reason for missteps. 
▪ A learning and research agenda and how this agenda will help achieve activity level 
results and contribute to national and international knowledge and learning. 
▪ Information about all activities to be monitored under the MEL Plan. The list of 
activities must be provided in a logical framework which: 




 

▪ Links activities to Agreement results—both those dictated by USAID in the program 
description and lower level or complementary results contained in the Recipient’s 
approach. 
▪ Describes assumptions being made about the relationship of the activity to the 
Agreement result. 





▪ Identifies the indicators against which progress is to be measured. Includes methods to 
be used for monitoring 
▪ Provides an illustrative schedule for discrete monitoring activities tied to the overall 
program implementation plan. 




 

● Gender Consideration: 


 

To the greatest extent possible, the Recipient should seek to include both men and women in 
all aspects of this program including participation and leadership in e.g., meetings, training, 
etc. The Recipient must collect, analyze and submit to USAID sex-disaggregated data and 
proposed actions that will address any identified gender-related issues. 

 

In order to ensure that USAID assistance makes the maximum optimal contribution to gender 
equality, performance management systems and evaluations must include gender-sensitive 
indicators and sex-disaggregated data when the technical analyses supporting the Agreement 
demonstrates that: 

 

▪ The different roles and status of women and men affect the activities to be undertaken; 
and 
▪ The anticipated results of the work would affect women and men differently. 


 

(3) Quarterly Performance Reports 

 

The Recipient will submit quarterly reports that give insight into the progress of planned 
activities. Such reports follow USAID fiscal quarters, i.e., Quarter 1 covers October-
December; Quarter 2 covers January-March; Quarter 3 covers April-June; Quarter 4 covers 
July-September. The quarterly report is due within 30 days after the fiscal quarter’s end. In 
lieu of the fourth quarter report, the Recipient will submit an Annual Progress Report (see 
Section F.4(4)4 below). 

 

The narrative report will include qualitative and quantitative information describing activities 
carried out and specific results achieved during the quarter. In addition, the narrative report 
will indicate key implementation challenges encountered and how they were, or are planned to 
be, resolved. To the extent where MEL Plan includes quarterly targets, this should be reflected 
in the narrative report. 

 

(4) Annual Progress Reports 

 

The Recipient must submit an annual progress report within 30 days after the end of the fiscal 

year to cover annual performance from the fiscal year. At a minimum, both quarterly and 
annual progress reports will contain:

standards completed) made since the last report by region and province as 
applicable 
● Problems encountered and whether they were solved or are still outstanding 



● Proposed solutions to new or ongoing problems 
● Success stories 
● Security concerns 
● Information on new opportunities for program expansion 
● Qualitative data on program achievement and results 
● Updated/filled MEL Plan, as an attachment

ANNEX 3: PRELIMINARY GENDER EQUALITY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION 
ANALYSIS 

BACKGROUND 

Pursuant to ADS 205.3.1 and in alignment with the USAID Gender Equality and Female 
Empowerment Policy, individual Operating Units (OU) are responsible for conducting gender 
analyses at the design stage of a new activity and for ensuring that the Policy is implemented 
throughout each stage of the Program Cycle. This Gender Analysis pertains to the design of 
USAID/India’s planned Trees Outside Forests in India Activity, which aims to expand trees 
outside of forests in India for enhanced provision of ecosystem services and increased inclusive 
economic opportunities. India’s ability to achieve important national and international 
commitments depends on her capacity to increase the productivity and profitability of 
agroforests, farmforests and urban forests, and as critical components of inclusive and 
sustainable economic growth that meets local needs and addresses global environmental 
challenges. The activity complements USAID/India’s ongoing Forest-PLUS 2.0 activity and the 
Sustainable Landscapes DCA that will provide a portfolio-risk credit guarantee to incentivize 
private capital mobilization. 

The proposed activity will continue the successful model of close collaboration and cooperation 
among implementing partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID/India), 
the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) of the GoI, academic and 
research institutions, private sector entities. Through this proposed activity, USAID and GoI will 
partner with farmers and farmer producer organizations, public (urban) and private land 
managers, processors and traders in agroforestry products, business incubators, insurance 
companies, and many other stakeholders to enhance productivity, strengthen value chains, and 
forge partnerships for sustainable growth that contributes to India meeting its goals of economic 
and ecological sustainability through landscape management. 

There are three overarching objectives for this activity: 1. Strengthen the enabling environment 
for TOF expansion in India; 2. Incentivize TOF through reduced risks and improved economic 
opportunities; and 3. Enhance information systems and processes to support TOF. 

GENDER ANALYSIS 

Investments in gender equality and social inclusion can positively impact women’s and men’s 
(including marginalized and vulnerable groups’) livelihoods, health, and education, as well as 
improve their stewardship and management of land and associated resources. USAID recognizes 
that an effective project must work to close the following gender gaps in the Indian forestry/ 
agriculture/ agroforestry sector: 


● Ensure that women and marginalized groups( women, the landless, marginal farmers, the 
disabled and youth) are meaningfully able to participate in decision-making; 

● Enhance women’s access to agroforestry related markets and revenues via access to financial 
services and technical assistance; 

● Design/demonstrate agroforestry models that meets the needs and priorities of women and 
marginalized groups; 

● Organize training programs suited to the specific requirements of women and marginalized 
communities; and 

● Monitor and reduce the gaps in wages among women and men workers engaged in 
agriculture/agroforestry. It is important to note that a gender analysis is not a “woman’s 
analysis,” but needs to consider the different threats, impacts, and opportunities of each gender. 
As such, this analysis considers gender issues throughout the various stages of the TOFI – from 
activity design and implementation, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and learning and 
adapting. The analysis given below was done based on extensive desk study. 

Laws, Policies, Regulations, and Institutional Practices. 

In recent times there has been efforts to make policies, laws and regulations gender sensitive, and 
there have been conscious efforts by government agencies to empower women and marginalized 
communities. For example, one of the main objectives of India’s National Agroforestry Policy, 
2014 is to enhance the livelihood opportunities of small farmers, the landless and women. 

Although the environment policy for addressing gender inequity has improved slightly over the 
past decade, women continue to be disadvantaged by insecure access and property rights to land 
resources, by discrimination and male bias in the provision of services like credit and 
technology, and by exclusion from decision making at household, community and national 
levels. 

And, throughout the country, there may be implicit gender biases in the manner in which the 
laws, policies, and regulations are implemented and enforced - as many women and marginalized 
groups may not have access to pertinent information regarding their applicability and associated 
consequences if violated. 

Cultural Norms and Beliefs. 

In a large and diverse country such as India, there is an extreme variance in cultural norms and 
beliefs throughout India. However, in both traditional and progressive communities and 
households, some commonalities exist regarding how men and women behave in social 
situations and interact with one another. Of note, gender self-segregation occurs in many parts of 


the country throughout various social strata. In public/social situations that are mixed, it is often 
men who have louder voices and are in stronger positions to set cultural, political, and economic 
agendas. Similarly, people from the LBGT communities are often discriminated against and 
often don’t participate in social and public events and gatherings. All of these can have 
implications in forest/agroforestry sector planning and strategic design. 

Land ownership and inheritance. 

It is men who primarily own the land in India, with only 10.3 percent of the land owned by 
women. This is primarily due to traditional social norms that favor male inheritance. While the 
inheritance laws have progressively been amended to give equal inheritance rights for sons and 
daughters, the laws have been largely ineffective in practice. For example, the Hindu Succession 
Act was amended at the national level in 2005 providing equal inheritance rights to widows, sons 
and daughters when a man dies intestate. However, more often the legal rights of women laid 
down in such laws are not invoked, either due to societal pressures or lack of awareness of the 
legal provisions. 

With respect to marginalized groups, members of marginalized communities and certain 
religious groups (such as Muslims) have lower rates of land ownership compared to others. For 
example, 93 percent of Scheduled Caste (SC) members are marginal farmers, owning less than 
one hectare as of 2013. On the other hand, there are provisions in the Indian constitution and in 
relevant laws that protect the interest of the marginalized communities. For instance, the “Fifth 
Schedule of the Indian constitution declares areas which have predominance of Scheduled Tribes 
(ST) as “Scheduled Areas”' to protect the tribal autonomy and culture. Many states have passed 
laws to regulate sale or lease of land in Scheduled areas to non-tribals. 

Gender Roles, Responsibilities, and Time Use. 

Increasingly, women comprise a greater portion of India’s labor force. However, throughout 
much of the country, men and women assume traditional gender roles with regard to 
employment, productive/social use of time, household responsibilities, and foci of educational 
pursuits. 

In the agriculture and agroforestry sector too, women play a significant and crucial role. There is 
hardly any activity in agricultural production, except maybe plowing, in which women are not 
actively involved. Women perform labor intensive jobs such as weeding, hoeing, harvesting, etc. 
And agriculture continues to absorb and employ 2/3rd of the female workforce but fails to give 
them recognition of employed labor. In addition to their labor inputs, women possess detailed 
knowledge about agriculture and use of plant products and are primarily responsible for 
production of secondary crops such as pulses and vegetables which are important sources of 
nutrition to their families. 


Men’s and women’s choices vary when it comes to selection of crops. For instance, with respect 
to agroforestry species, men often prefer cash crops like timber trees while women’s priority is 
for food security, thereby preferring fruit trees over timber trees. However, experience from 
across India indicates that it’s men’s preferences that prevail. 

The technological innovations in agriculture are primarily focused on addressing the needs of 
men. Mechanization, for example alleviates the burden of tasks that are the responsibility of 
men, leaving women’s burden unattended. Experience from various agriculture programs also 
indicate that training is primarily targeted at men, addressing their needs and convenience. 
Considering the dual responsibilities of women, within and outside their homes, there is a need 
for organizing training programs specific to the needs of women and at a time and location 
convenient to them. 

Control over Assets and Resources, and Decision-making 

In India, as men migrate to urban areas for non-farm sector employment, women are increasingly 
playing a greater role in agriculture. As a result of the outward migration of men, women 
managed households now comprise 32% of the rural houses. This fact along with the equality 
issue make a strong case for women to have ownership/co-ownership and control over land 
resources. However, women continue to remain the largest group of landless laborers with little 
real security in case of break-up of the family owing to death or divorce; inheritance laws and 
customs discriminate against women and give sole title to land – and hence the security needed 
for obtaining production credits – to the men. Research from several Indian states indicate that 
women’s ownership of land and/or house reduces domestic violence against women. 

Women are largely viewed as helpers rather than farmers and rarely have control over the money 
they earn through agriculture. Further, as many may not be the primary “bread-winners” in their 
household, women may not have a full grasp of family finances. 

The TOFI activity is not planning to address some of the inherent legal issues and the land 
ownership issues. The GOI specifically requested that USAID projects avoid work in the policy 
and legal structures, and requested the USAID remove activities that focused on these topics 
under past activities. However, this activity will address other gaps and barriers that will enable 
women and marginalized groups to actively participate and get benefitted from agroforestry 
interventions. The analysis below specially looks at the needs of women, the landless, marginal 
farmers, the disabled and youth. 

Analysis of Issues and Recommendations 

 

For those gender and social inclusion issues that have been identified, the table below presents 

recommended actions that will be taken by USAID and the implementing partner to ensure that 

gender equity and social inclusion remains at the forefront of the activity design.

Table 1. Potential gender and social inclusion issues and actions to address the issues 

 

 



Potential Gender and Social 
Inclusion Issues and 
Relevance to the Activity 

Recommendations, Specific Actions, General 
Considerations 



Normally women and 
marginalized communities 
are excluded from decision-
making with respect to 
agriculture and agroforestry. 

The gender and social inclusion analysis by the 
implementing agency will identify the barriers in the 
participation of women, marginalized communities, and 
youth, and will devise strategies to address these 
barriers. The activity will develop gender specific 
material ensuring that outreach and communication 
efforts are delivered in a language that is accessible to 
women. 

 

While facilitating value chains and setting up 
enterprises, TOFI activity will identify opportunities to 
promote women entrepreneurs and their products. The 
activity will also organize focused training for skill 
development of youth (including women), the disabled 
and the landless (for example in making good quality 
furniture from wood). Landless people typically don’t 
benefit from land management projects. Skill 
development of the landless would enable their 
participation in value chains. 



Poor participation of women 
and marginalized 
communities in training 
activities as those are not 
designed to address the 
needs and convenience of 
women and marginalized 
communities. 

The TOFI will encourage women from NGOs and 
communities to participate in consultations. TOFI 
activity will make all efforts to organize the meetings 
and training activities at such localities and at times 
which will enable participation of women (and 
marginalized communities). Also, efforts would be 
made to develop gender-specific outreach material, 
ensuring that outreach and communication efforts are 
delivered in a language/medium that is accessible to 
women. 



The technological 
innovations in 
agriculture/agroforestry are 
primarily focused on 
addressing the needs of men. 

While developing/demonstrating agroforestry models, 
TOFI activity will ensure that the preferences/needs of 
the women and marginalized communities are 
addressed. For example, women prefer agroforestry 
models based on fruit trees and small and marginal 
farmers (i.e., farmers with limited land holdings) 




generally prefer planting along farm boundaries as 
compared to inter cropping and block plantations. The 
activity will take these aspects into consideration while 
developing/demonstrating agroforestry models. 





Men and women are paid 
differently for similar 
efforts. 

In facilitating setting up of enterprises, the TOFI 
activity will sensitize potential entrepreneurs of the need 
for paying men and women equally for undertaking 
similar work.
