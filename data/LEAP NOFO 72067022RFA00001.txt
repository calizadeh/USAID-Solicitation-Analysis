SUMMARY 
The 
Libya 
Economic 
Acceleration 
Project, 
LEAP 
or 
Aqfuz 
(“Aqfuz” 
means 
“jump” 
or 
“leap” 
in 
Arabic) 
will 
promote 
an 
inclusive, 
private 
sector 
led 
economic 
growth 
and 
increase 
employment 
opportunities 
and 
economic 
diversification 
for 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
populations 
in 
different 
centers 
in 
Libya’s 
south 
and 
specifically 
the 
Fezzan 
Region. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
enhance 
resilience 
among 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
populations, 
including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
women, 
youth, 
minorities, 
indigenous 
groups 
(such 
as 
Tebus, 
Amazigh, 
and 
Tuaregs), 
people 
with 
disabilities, 
and 
internally 
displaced 
populations 
(IDPs). 


With 
the 
above 
in 
mind, 
the 
program 
will 
address 
some 
of 
the 
root 
causes 
of 
conflict 
in 
Libya’s 
south, 
especially 
those 
that 
are 
economic 
in 
nature. 
Poverty, 
unemployment, 
and 
inequality 
in 
economic 
opportunities 
within 
the 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
populations 
played 
a 
role 
in 
Libya’s 
current 
conflict 
and 
fragility. 
LEAP 
will 
enhance 
economic 
opportunities 
for 
the 
target 
group 
in 
Libya’s 
south 
by 
increasing 
their 
effectiveness 
through 
contributing 
to 
the 
following 
objectives 
1) 
strengthen 
entrepreneurship 
skills 
and 
opportunities 
for 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
populations; 
2) 
improve 
the 
productivity 
of 
Micro-, 
Small-and 
Medium-Enterprises 
(MSMEs) 
among 
the 
target 
populations; 
3) 
increase 
vocational 
and 
technical 
training 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
market 
demands, 
and 
4) 
increase 
assistance 
to 
businesses 
in 
all 
phases 
of 
their 
life 
cycle, 
all 
which 
will 
help 
build 
economic 
resilience 
among 
the 
target 
population 
andpromote 
stabilization, 
peacebuilding, 
and 
conflict 
prevention. 


A.2 
BACKGROUND 
a) 
GeneralBackgroundInformationandCountryContext 
The 
Libyan 
economy 
is 
highly 
dependent 
on 
the 
oil 
and 
gas 
sector 
and 
has 
a 
public 
sector 
that 
is 
large 
and 
inefficient. 
Oil 
accounts 
for 
around 
80 
percent 
of 
Libya’s 
gross 
domestic 
product 
(GDP) 
and 
nearly 
all 
government 
revenue. 
In 
2021, 
Libya 
earned 
$24.6 
billion 
in 
oil 
revenues, 
and 
the 
recent 
conflict 
in 
Ukraine 
has 
increased 
oil 
prices. 
If 
the 
oil 
prices 
stay 
stable 
atover 
$100 
per 
barrel,Libya’s 
oil 
revenues 
in 
2022 
are 
expected 
to 
reach 
more 
than 
$37 
billion. 
The 
non-hydrocarbon-relatedprivate 
sector 
shareof 
Libya’s 
GDP 
is 
very 
low 
and 
was 
struck 
by 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
particularly 
the 
service 
sector 
(trade, 
transport), 
construction, 
and 
light 
manufacturing 
(agro-industries, 
handicrafts). 
Despite 
that, 
Libya’s 
GDP 
could 
increase 
from 
about 
$30 
billion 
in 
2021 
to 
$50 
billion 
in 
2022 
due 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
global 
oilprices. 


Despite 
heavy 
over-reliance 
on 
public 
sector 
employment, 
only 
about 
half 
of 
working-age 
Libyans 
are 
active 
in 
the 
labor 
force, 
and 
the 
country 
suffers 
from 
generally 
high 
unemployment 
rates. 
The 
World 
Bank 
estimated 
the 
2019 
overall 
unemployment 
rate 
to 
be18.6 
percent. 
As 
of 
2017, 
there 
are 
an 
estimated 


1.7 
million 
Libyans 
on 
the 
public 
payroll, 
with 
salaries 
taking 
up 
more 
than 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
government 
budget. 
Public 
sector 
employment 
includes 
almost 
400,000 
employees 
of 
public 
enterprises, 
whichdominate 
most 
economic 
sectors. 
Additionally,youthunemployment,whichhasconsistently 
been 
elevated, 
reached 
an 
estimated 
48 
percent 
in 
2015, 
and 
20.3 
percent 
of 
the 
labor 
force 
are 
seeking 
their 
first 
job. 
Libya 
is 
struggling 
to 
provideemployment 
for 
youthdue 
to 
public 
sector 
fiscal 
constraints 
anda 
shortage 
of 
jobs 
in 
the 
limited 
private 
sector. 
A 
recent 
USAID/Libya 
youth 
analysis 
highlighted 
the 

Notice 
of 
Funding 
Opportunity 
Number:72067022RFA00001 


importance 
of 
targeting 
youth. 
The 
report 
noted 
that 
young 
men 
are 
at 
risk 
of 
recruitment 
into 
violent 
groups 
and/or 
illicitactivities, 
due 
to 
un-orunderemployment, 
poor 
quality 
education, 
youth 
exclusion 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
attractions 
ofmilitias 
in 
terms 
of 
income, 
power, 
and 
securityon 
the 
other. 


In 
the 
labor 
market, 
women 
are 
not 
allowed 
the 
same 
opportunities 
as 
men, 
which 
is 
reflected 
in 
their 
participation 
and 
employment 
levels. 
Estimates 
of 
the 
2018 
female 
labor 
force 
participation 
rate 
are 
at 
a 
low 
25.8%, 
compared 
to 
79.1 
percent 
for 
males. 
Estimates 
of 
female 
unemployment 
are 
at 
28%, 
while 
unemployment 
is 
lower 
at 
19 
percent 
for 
males. 
According 
to 
World 
Bank 
estimates, 
59.6 
percent 
of 
women 
held 
an 
account 
at 
a 
financial 
institution, 
not 
too 
far 
behind 
the 
70.7% 
of 
men 
with 
an 
account. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
reports 
that 
70 
percent 
of 
staff 
are 
female, 
but 
less 
than 
one 
percent 
of 
these 
employees 
holdleadership 
positions. 


Historically 
marginalized 
populations 
in 
southern 
Libya 
face 
particular 
challenges 
to 
increased 
economic 
inclusion. 
Southern 
Libya 
suffers 
from 
lack 
of 
viable 
economic 
opportunities, 
and 
trafficking 
and 
the 
illicit 
economy 
plays 
a 
key 
role 
in 
sustaining 
the 
livelihood 
of 
communities. 
A 
large 
portion 
of 
the 
country's 
minorities, 
including 
indigenous 
groups 
such 
as 
Tuareg, 
Tebu, 
and 
Amazigh, 
live 
in 
southern 
Libya 
and 
have 
faced 
systemic 
exclusion 
from 
the 
country's 
political 
and 
economic 
life. 
This 
situation 
creates 
openings 
for 
destabilizing 
elements 
to 
capitalize 
on 
conflict 
and 
community 
grievances. 
To 
promote 
longer-term 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
Libya, 
it 
is 
critical 
to 
spur 
the 
formal 
economy 
in 
southern 
Libya 
to 
create 
new 
economic 
opportunities, 
including 
for 
marginalized 
groups. 


The 
development 
of 
a 
dynamic 
private 
sector, 
in 
particular, 
Micro-, 
Small-and 
Medium-Enterprises 
(MSMEs), 
and 
an 
environment 
conducive 
to 
entrepreneurship 
will 
be 
essential 
for 
employment 
creation, 
productivity 
and 
a 
more 
balanced 
economic 
diversification, 
for 
all 
of 
Libyabut 
mainly 
forthe 
vulnerable 
and 
historicallymarginalized 
population 
in 
thesouth. 
Private 
sector 
development 
could 
be 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
broader 
peacebuilding 
and 
conflict 
management 
processes. 
Providing 
inclusiveeconomicopportunities 
for 
the 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
populations 
is 
essential 
for 
sustainable 
stabilization 
in 
Libya’s 
south. 
Improvedentrepreneurship 
and 
anexpanded 
role 
for 
MSMEs 
are 
particularlyimportantfor 
economic 
recovery 
because 
of 
their 
potential 
to 
generate 
jobs 
generally, 
and 
mainly 
because 
they 
can 
employ 
vulnerable 
populations. 


b) 
Development 
Challenge 
The 
activity 
will 
support 
the 
goal 
of 
USAID/Libya 
Strategic 
Framework 
2021-2024 
“Strengthen 
the 
foundations 
of 
a 
more 
stable, 
inclusive, 
and 
self-reliant 
Libya.” 
Specifically, 
LEAP 
will 
contribute 
to 
development 
objectives 
2, 
“Libyans 
empowered 
to 
mitigate 
drivers 
of 
instability 
and 
conflict,” 
through 
Area 
2.2, 
“Strengthening 
Entrepreneurship”, 
and 
Area 
2.4, 
“Supporting 
conflict 
affected 
and 
vulnerable 
populations.” 
Traditionally 
marginalized 
populations 
in 
Libya’s 
south 
can 
be 
empowered 
through 
capacity 
building 
and 
human 
capital 
development, 
support 
to 
NGOs 
that 
represent 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
Libyan 
interests, 
and 
support 
to 
private 
sector 
SMEs 
and 
entrepreneurs 
to 
diversify 
the 
economy 
in 
Libya’s 
south. 
Furthermore, 
Libyans 
are 
also 
considered 
empowered 
if 
theyreceive 
services 
thatimprovetheirlivelihoodsandenablethemto 
pursuetheirneedseffectively. 


Thus, 
the 
development 
challenge 
is 
to 
empower 
Libyans 
to 
mitigate 
drivers 
of 
instability 
andconflict 
by 


supporting 
conflict 
affected 
areas 
and 
vulnerable 
populations 
to 
achieve 
economic 
resilience 
by 
strengthening 
entrepreneurship, 
productivity,vocational 
training 
and 
increasing 
assistance 
tobusinesses. 


Libya’s 
Strategic 
Framework’s 
Cross-cutting 
programming 
principles 
and 
operations 
related 
to 
inclusion, 
Libyan 
empowerment, 
flexibility/adaptation, 
and 
conflict 
sensitivity 
must 
be 
defined 
and 
integrated 
by 
the 
implementer 
throughout 
theActivity.

PROGRAMDESCRIPTIONOBJECTIVESANDEXPECTEDOUTCOMES 
a) 
Objectives: 
Understanding 
the 
basics 
of 
the 
economy 
in 
Libya’s 
south 
is 
key 
to 
the 
success 
of 
this 
program. 
The 
program 
will 
provide 
interventions 
in 
several 
economic 
centers 
in 
Libya’s 
south 
to 
address 
the 
historical 
nexus 
between 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
populations 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
economic 
opportunities 
andeconomicresilience. 


LEAP 
will 
address 
someof 
theroot 
causes 
of 
conflict 
in 
Libya’s 
south, 
especially 
those 
thatare 
economic 
in 
nature. 
Poverty, 
unemployment, 
and 
inequality 
in 
economic 
opportunities 
within 
the 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
populations 
played 
a 
role 
in 
Libya’s 
current 
conflict 
and 
fragility. 
The 
activity 
aims 
at 
building 
economic 
resilience 
in 
Libya’s 
south, 
specifically 
the 
Fezzan 
Region. 
By 
supporting 
LEAP’s 
four 
main 
objectives 
below, 
the 
activity 
will 
help 
promote 
peace, 
conflict 
prevention, 
and 
stability 
in 
Libya’s 
south: 
1) 
to 
strengthen 
entrepreneurship 
skills 
and 
opportunities 
for 
vulnerable 
and 
historically 
marginalized 
populations; 
2) 
improve 
productivity 
of 
Micro-, 
Small-andMedium-Enterprises 
(MSMEs) 
among 
the 
target 
populations; 
3) 
increase 
vocational 
and 
technical 
training 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
market 
demands, 
and 
4) 
increase 
assistance 
to 
businesses 
in 
all 
phases 
of 
their 
life 
cycle. 
The 
program 
will 
create 
economic 
opportunities 
to 
improve 
livelihoods 
among 
the 
target 
group 
to 
enhance 
their 
integration 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
Libya 
and 
contribute 
to 
collective 
efforts 
in 
stabilization 
and 
peaceful 
local 
reconciliation. 
The 
recipient 
needs 
to 
identify 
specific 
challenges 
for 
the 
target 
population 
and 
communities 
and 
propose 
a 
tailoredapproach 
to 
address 
those 
particular 
challenges. 


Examples 
of 
vulnerable 
and 
traditionally 
marginalized 
populations 
for 
this 
activity 
include 
but 
are 
not 
limited 
to, 
youth, 
women, 
minorities, 
indigenous 
groups 
(such 
as 
Tebus, 
Amazigh, 
and 
Tuaregs), 
people 
with 
disabilities,and 
internally 
displaced 
people. 


b) 
Expected 
outcomes 
and 
Indicators: 
● 
MSMEs 
growing 
and 
creating 
employment. 
● 
Potential 
entrepreneurs 
have 
improved 
business 
skills. 
● 
Targeted 
groups 
are 
more 
employable 
and 
better 
employed 
as 
a

Development 
Hypothesis: 
If 
historically 
marginalized 
and 
vulnerable 
Libyans 
(i.e., 
women, 
youth, 
minorities, 
indigenous 
populations, 
people 
with 
disabilities, 
IDPs, 
etc.) 
are 
given 
better 
economic 
opportunities 
to 
reduce 
poverty, 
unemployment, 
and 
inequality 
in 
economic 
opportunities 
within 
their 
communities, 
they 
will 
be 
more 
empowered 
to 
prevent 
conflict 
and 
promote 
peace 
andstabilityin 
Libya’s 
southand 
specifically 
theFezzan 
Region. 
d) 
Assumptions: 
USAID 
recognizes 
that 
the 
operating 
environment 
in 
Libya 
is 
challenging, 
particularly 
as 
it 
relates 
to 
security, 
reliable 
supply 
of 
electricity 
and 
internet 
coverage, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
business 
economic 
environment 
for 
promoting 
private 
business 
development. 
However, 
the 
LEAP 
activity 
assumes 
that 
the 
overall 
objectives 
can 
be 
achieved, 
in 
spite 
ofthese 
challenges. 
This 
assumption 
is 
based 
on 
the 
experiences 
of 
current 
projects 
funded 
by 
other 
donors 
in 
this 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
USAID’s 
previous 
project 
Libya 
Economic 
Empowerment 
(LEE). 
A.4 
INTERVENTIONS 
The 
Applicant 
will 
identify 
needs 
and 
tailored 
approaches 
for 
stabilization 
in 
target 
communities 
and 
target 
groups. 
Ultimately, 
this 
activity 
could 
promote 
private 
sector 
development 
by 
supporting 
MSMEs 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
employment 
opportunities 
and 
to 
diversify 
the 
economy 
in 
Libya’s 
south 
to 
promote 
economic 
resilience 
which 
will 
contribute 
to 
stability, 
peace, 
and 
conflictprevention. 
In 
sum, 
theactivity 
will 
strengthen 
entrepreneurship 
skills 
and 
opportunities 
for 
growth 
for 
the 
target 
population 
in 
Libya’s 
south 
and 
provide 
entrepreneurship 
and 
MSME 
business 
development 
services 
through 
local 
organizations, 
such 
as 
incubators 
and 
accelerator 
programs. 
Other 
ideas 
and 
approaches, 
tailored 
to 
specific 
geographic 
areas 
or 
marginalized 
communities 
in 
Libya’s 
south, 
that 
will 
improve 
economic 
resilience 
for 
the 
target 
population 
are 
also 
welcomed. 
The 
Applicant’s 
proposed 
approaches 
must 
be 
informed 
by 
recent 
data 
and 
analysis. 
As 
applicable, 
the 
Applicant 
can 
propose 
additional 
analysis 
that 
willbe 
conducted 
once 
the 
activity 
is 
on 
the 
ground 
to 
further 
inform 
the 
implementation 
approach. 


A.5 
MANAGEMENTPLATFORM 
The 
interventions 
under 
this 
activity 
will 
take 
place 
in 
Libya’s 
south 
and 
specifically 
the 
Fezzan 
Region 
and 
the 
program 
is 
expected 
to 
establish 
some 
presence 
in 
the 
south 
to 
better 
implement 
this 
activity. 
While 
USAID 
understands 
the 
possible 
need 
for 
some 
management/staffing/programs 
to 
be 
held 
regionally 
out 
of 
Tunis, 
this 
should 
be 
on 
a 
limited 
basis 
and 
with 
clear 
justification. 
The 
Recipient 
will 
have 
a 
clear 
management 
platform, 
including 
a 
startup 
plan 
that 
addresses 
both 
flexiblemanagement 
and 
a 
robustfootprint 
within 
Libya’s 
south 
and, 
as 
necessary,

GEOGRAPHICSCOPEANDCRISISPROVISION 
The 
geographic 
focus 
of 
this 
activity 
will 
be 
Libya’s 
South 
and 
specifically 
the 
Fezzan 
Region. 
We 
encourage 
the 
Applicant 
to 
consider 
areas 
where 
development 
agenciesand 
programs 
don’t 
usually 
work. 
However, 
allowing 
for 
a 
flexible 
implementation 
in 
unforeseen 
circumstances 
(such 
as 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
if 
political 
context 
or 
USG 
priorities 
change, 
in 
an 
event 
of 
a 
crisis 
or 
in 
an 
event 
of 
other 
emerging 
economic 
challengesduring 
implementation 
of 
this 
program),the 
activities 
could 
be 
implemented 
in 
other 
regions 
of 
Libya 
including 
the 
East 
and 
West 
subject 
to 
USAID’s 
review 
and 
approvalduringthe 
activity 
implementation 
stage. 


In 
the 
event 
of 
unforeseen 
circumstances, 
the 
Recipient 
will 
be 
allowed 
to 
propose 
program 
adjustments 
and 
solutions 
that 
will 
achieve 
the 
outlined 
objectives 
to 
the 
Agreement 
Officer. 
There 
is 
a 
probability 
of 
a 
crisis 
developing 
in 
the 
operating 
environmentduringthe 
life 
ofthis 
activity. 
If 
a 
crisis 
developsor 
in 
an 
event 
of 
other 
unforeseen 
circumstances, 
it 
is 
imperative 
to 
use 
adaptive 
management 
principles 
to 
respond 
immediately, 
such 
as 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
moving 
implementation 
to 
other 
regions 
of 
Libya, 
aswell 
as 
maintaining 
development 
gains 
achieved 
through 
activity 
implementation 
up 
untilthe 
crisis. 
When 
the 
USAID/Libya 
Country 
Representative 
has 
formally 
declared 
a 
crisis 
in 
writing, 
the 
Agreement 
Officer 
will, 
through 
oral 
or 
written 
communication, 
solicit 
a 
crisis 
response 
proposal 
for 
adjustment 
from 
the 
awardee 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
crisis 
and 
maintain 
gains. 
The 
awardee 
will 
submitthe 
crisis 
response 
proposal 
for

to 
the 
Agreement 
Officer 
in 
the

C.1 
ELIGIBLEAPPLICANTS 
U.S. 
and 
non-US 
organizations 
may 
participate 
under 
this 
NOFO. 
For 
thepurposes 
of 
this 
NOFO, 
Non-
Governmental 
Organizations 
(NGOs) 
include 
anyincorporated 
entity, 
either 
non-profit 
or 
for-profit, 
other 
than 
a 
governmental 
organization. 
All 
applicants 
must 
be 
physically 
able 
to 
operate 
in 
Libya 
includingsuccessfullyobtaining 
needed 
registrations, 
permits 
and 
access 
to 
work 
in 
Libya. 
To 
be 
eligible 
for 
award 
of 
a 
cooperative 
agreement, 
in 
addition 
to 
other 
conditions 
of 
this 
NOFO, 
organizations 
must 
be 
politically 
neutral 
and 
have 
a 
commitment 
to 
non-discrimination 
with 
respect 
to 
beneficiaries 
and 
adherence 
to 
equal 
opportunity 
employment 
practices. 
Non-discrimination 
includes 
equal 
treatment 
without 
regard 
to 
race, 
religion, 
ethnicity, 
gender, 
and 
political 
affiliation. 
Pursuant 
to 
2 
CFR 
200.400(g), 
USAID 
policy 
is 
not 
to 
award 
profit 
under 
assistance 
instruments. 
However, 
all 
reasonable, 
allocable, 
and 
allowable 
expenses, 
both 
direct 
and 
indirect, 
which 
are 
related 
to 
the 
grant 
program 
and 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
applicable 
cost 
standards 
(2 
CFR 
200 
and 
2 
CFR 
700), 
may 
be 
paid 
undertheAgreement. 


In 
order 
for 
an 
award 
to 
be 
made, 
the 
AO 
must 
make 
a 
positive 
“risk 
assessment,” 
as 
discussed 
in 
ADS 


303.3.9. 
This 
means 
that 
the 
applicant 
must 
possess, 
or 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
obtain, 
the 
necessary 
management 
and 
technical 
competence 
to 
conduct 
the 
proposed 
program. 
The 
applicant 
must 
agree 
to 
practice 
mutually 
agreed-upon 
methods 
of 
accountability 
for 
funds 
and 
other 
assets 
provided 
or 
funded 
by 
USAID. 
If 
notified 
byUSAID 
thata 
pre-award 
survey 
is 
necessary, 
the 
applicant 
must 
prepare 
in 
advance 
the 
required 
information 
and 
documents. 
Prospective 
NGO 
applicants 
should 
refer 
to 
ADS 
Chapter 
303.3.9.1 
for 
additional 
information 
about 
pre-award 
surveys. 
A 
pre-award 
survey 
does 
not 
commit 
USAID 
to 
make 
an 
award 
to 
any 
entity. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
positive 
risk 
assessment, 
an 
award 
can 
ordinarily 
not 
be 
made. 
However, 
in 
rare 
cases, 
an 
award 
can 
be 
made 
with 
“Specific 
Conditions” 
(e.g., 
additional 
non-standard 
award 
requirements 
designed 
to 
minimize 
the 
risk 
presented 
to 
USAID 
of 
making 
an 
award 
to 
an 
NGO 
for 
which 
a 
positive 
risk 
assessment 
cannot 
be 
made), 
but 
only 
where 
it 
appears 
likely 
that 
the 
applicant 
can 
correct 
the 
deficiencyin 
a 
reasonable 
period. 
C.2 
COSTSHARINGORMATCHING 
Cost 
sharing 
is 
encouraged 
but 
is 
not 
required. 
Cost 
share 
is 
defined 
by 
USAID 
as 
“contributions, 
both 
cash 
and 
in-kind, 
which 
are 
necessary 
and 
reasonable 
to 
achieve 
program 
objectives 
and 
which 
are 
verifiable 
from 
the 
Recipient’s 
records.” 
Cost 
sharing 
also 
refers 
to 
that 
portion 
of 
a 
program 
cost 
not 
borne 
by 
the 
USG. 
Such 
funds 
may 
be 
mobilized 
from 
the 
recipient; 
other 
multilateral, 
bilateral, 
and 
foundation 
donors; 
host 
governments; 
and 
local 
organizations, 
communities

two 
(2) 
phases 
totheapplication 
underthis 
NOFO: 


PHASE 
ONE 
(1) 
-CONCEPT 
PAPER: 
A 
concept 
paper 
is 
a 
short

where 
the 
Applicant 
provides 
an 
overview 
of 
how 
you

problem 
description. 
During 
Phase 
One 
(1), 
the 
Selection 
Committee 
(SC) 
willreview 
and 
evaluate 
the 
concept 
papers. 
The 
concept 
paper 
should 
be 
specific, 
complete 
and 
presented 
concisely. 
The 
concept 
paper 
should 
concisely 
demonstrate 
the

capabilities 
and 
expertise 
with 
respect 
to 
achieving 
the 
objectives 
of 
this 
activity. 
The 
Applicant 
should 
take 
into 
account 
the 
concept 
paper’s 
submission 
requirements 
and 
evaluation 
criteria 
found 
in 
this 
NOFO. 
Applicants 
should 
only 
submit 
the

papers 
responsive 
to 
the 
NOFO. 
The 
purpose 
of 
discussion 
is 
to 
validate 
and 
clarify 
design 
assumptions 
and 
proposed 
technical 
approaches 
including 
activities, 
interventions 
and 
application 
of 
implementation 
principles. 
Discussions 
may 
take 
place 
in 
many 
forms

phone 
calls, 
emails 
and 
in-person 
communications. 
Based 
on 
the 
merit 
review 
and 
potential

despitechallenges 
posed 
by 
the 
Libyan 
context.The

will 
have 
to 
be

to 
the 
USAID 
AOR 
andAO 
prior

IMPLEMENTATION 
PRINCIPLES 


Implementation 
principles 
must 
be 
clearly 
articulated 
and 
integrated 
throughout 
the 
designed 
approach. 
USAID 
is 
seeking 
inclusion 
ofthe 
below 
key 
principles: 


– 
Conflict 
Sensitive 
Programming: 
A 
conflict-sensitive 
or 
“do 
no 
harm” 
approach 
is 
critical 
in 
Libya. 
All 
activities 
will 
havea 
conflict 
sensitive 
lens 
at 
theforefront 
integrating 
ongoing 
conflict 
analysis 
to 
ensure 
continued 
appropriateness 
and 
that 
activities 
do 
not 
exacerbate 
conflict 
or 
divisions. 
Central 
to 
the 
conflict-sensitive 
approach 
is 
the 
question 
of 
how 
program 
activities 
impact 
conflict 
dynamics 
and 
vice 
versa. 
Inclusivity 
is 
a 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
conflict 
sensitivity. 
To 
the 
maximum 
extent 
possible, 
marginalized 
groups 
are 
incorporated 
intodesigned 
programs 
but 
not 
exclusively 
or 
at 
the 
risk 
of 
exacerbating 
conflict 
by 
excluding 
other 
groups, 
such 
as 
men 
and 
boys. 
Ongoing 
conflict 
analyses 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
inform 
project 
activities 
and 
must 
beincorporated 
into 
thelearningagenda 
throughout 
theproject. 
– 
Coordination 
and 
Collaboration: 
There 
are 
numerous 
efforts 
planned 
and 
ongoing, 
to 
support 
improved 
entrepreneurship 
and 
vocational 
and 
technical 
training. 
While 
donors 
seek 
to 
ensure 
close 
coordination 
and 
division 
of 
labor, 
these 
efforts 
must 
continue 
as 
new 
programming 
comes 
on 
line. 
When 
identifying 
opportunities 
for 
synergies 
with 
other 
USAID 
and 
donor 
funded 
activities 
working 
in 
the 
same 
municipality/community, 
it 
is 
imperative 
that 
interventions 
do 
not 
duplicate 
but 
rather 
complement 
activities 
conducted 
under 
other 
initiatives. 
– 
Social 
inclusion: 
Social 
inclusion 
is 
about 
achieving 
balance, 
fairness, 
representation, 
and 
diversity, 
especially 
for 
groups 
that 
are 
typically 
marginalized 
from 
opportunities 
such 
as 
women, 
ethnic/tribal/indigenous 
people, 
people 
with 
disabilities, 
internally 
displaced 
people, 
and 
youth. 
Designed 
initiatives 
must 
meaningfully 
promote 
social 
inclusion 
and 
measure 
social 
inclusion 
changes 
(e.g., 
empower 
women, 
girls, 
youth 
and 
other 
traditionally 
marginalized 
groups; 
propose 
activities 
that 
do 
not 
exacerbateor 
perpetuate 
gender 
and 
social 
disparities; 
hire 
women 
and 
other 
marginalized 
groups 
as 
project 
staff 
and 
advisors, 
seek 
opportunities 
for 
youth 
to 
be 
actively 
engaged 
in 
their 
communities, 
etc.). 
– 
Strengthen 
Self-Reliance: 
USAID/Libya 
is 
committed 
to 
strengthening 
and 
measuring 
self-
reliance. 
In 
Libya 
this 
means 
clearly 
incorporating 
sustainability 
into 
program 
activities 
and 

Notice 
of 
Funding 
Opportunity 
Number:72067022RFA00001 


providing 
assistance 
that 
strengthens 
theabilityof 
MSMEs 
to 
operate 
successfully 
beyond 
the 
life 
of 
this 
program. 
This 
includes 
ensuring 
beneficiaries 
are 
applying 
the 
skills 
and 
knowledge 
gained, 
and 
there 
is 
aneffort 
to 
measure 
improvements 
inbusiness 
performance. 


– 
Geographic 
Focus: 
The 
geographic 
focus 
of 
this 
activity 
will 
be 
Libya’s 
South 
and 
specifically 
the 
Fezzan 
Region. 
However, 
allowing 
for 
a 
flexibleimplementation 
inunforeseen 
circumstances 
(such 
as 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
if 
the 
political 
context 
or 
USGpriorities 
change, 
inan 
event 
of 
a 
crisis 
or 
in 
an 
event 
of 
other 
emerging 
economic 
challenges 
during 
implementation 
of 
this 
program), 
the 
activities 
could 
be 
implemented 
in 
other 
regions 
of 
Libya 
including 
East 
and 
West 
subject 
to 
USAID’s 
review 
and 
approval 
during 
the 
activity 
implementation 
stage 
(See 
A.7 
GEOGRAPHIC 
SCOPE 
AND 
CRISIS 
PROVISION). 
– 
Expanding 
USAID’s 
local 
partnership 
base: 
Use 
of 
partnerships, 
including 
with 
local 
organizations 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
explicitly 
expand 
USAID/Libya’s 
partnership 
base 
in 
line 
with 
theAgency’s 
New 
Partnerships 
Initiative 
principles 
is 
encouraged. 
– 
Monitoring, 
Evaluation 
and 
Learning: 
The 
Recipient 
will 
employ 
a 
comprehensive 
and 
effective 
approach 
to 
monitoring, 
evaluation, 
and 
learning 
(MEL), 
including 
evaluating 
the 
outcomes 
of 
program 
activities, 
documenting 
changes 
and 
achievements 
reasonably 
attributable 
to 
the 
program, 
learning 
and 
adapting 
from 
continual 
analysis 
and 
evaluation 
of 
data, 
and 
applying 
learning 
within 
the 
period 
of 
performance 
to 
increasethe 
achievement 
of 
sustainable 
results. 
The 
Recipient 
will 
be 
required 
to 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
USAID’s 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
contractor 
on 
data 
collection 
and 
verification. 
The 
Recipient 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
developing 
and 
implementing 
an 
AMELP 
aligned 
with 
expected 
outcomes 
of 
this 
program. 
In 
designing 
the 
AMELP, 
the 
Recipient 
is 
expected 
to 
(1) 
allocate 
sufficienthuman 
and 
financial 
resources 
within 
the 
program 
budget 
necessary 
for 
its 
successful 
implementation, 
(2) 
provide 
a 
clear 
description 
of 
methods 
to 
monitor 
and 
measure 
results, 
collect 
data 
and 
apply 
analysis 
and 
learning, 
and 
(3) 
ensure 
direct 
attribution 
of 
changes 
measured, 
as 
feasible. 
The 
AMELP 
is 
expected 
to 
facilitate 
flexibility 
in 
activityimplementation 
toallow 
for 
coursecorrections 
andduplicationof 
successful 
approaches. 
It 
will 
also 
address 
how 
the 
Applicant 
will 
monitor, 
evaluate 
andlearndespite 
access 
and 
security 
challenges 
posed 
by 
the 
context. 
Examples 
of 
context 
indicators 
that 
the 
Recipient 
will 
be 
expected 
to 
monitor 
include 
the 
number 
and 
nature 
of 
security 
incidents 
and 
freedom 
of 
movementin 
municipalities 
where 
the 
Recipient 
works. 
TheAMELPisalsoexpectedtoinclude 
distinctive 
monitoring, 
evaluation, 
and

information 
to 
ensure 
that 
USAID/Libya 
can 
describe 
the

However, 
considering 
the

THRESHOLD DETERMINATION AND SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

PROJECT/ACTIVITY SUMMARY 

The Libya Economic Acceleration Project (LEAP/Aqfuz) will promote an inclusive, private sector 
led economic growth for vulnerable communities in Libya. This project will ultimately result in 
increasing employment opportunities 
and increasing 
diversification 
in Libya’s economy 
to 
promote resilience in general. LEAP is designed to be implemented throughout Libya, including 
the west, east and south. At the end of the project period, the following results are expected: 
strengthened entrepreneurship skills and opportunities for vulnerable groups including youth, 
women, people with disabilities and indigenous people; improved productivity of Micro-, Small-
and Medium-Enterprises (MSMEs) among the targeted populations; increased vocational and 
technical training with a focus on employment demand, and increased assistance to 
businesses in all phases of their life cycle with support for financing, international trade, 
contracting, business management and assistance, and disaster recovery, among others. 

DEFERRAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 

USAID environmental procedures require environmental review of potential impacts of USAID 
programs, projects, and activities. The environmental review can be deferred under two 
situations: 

1) When USAID does not have sufficient information for meaningful environmental 
analysis, and therefore a Threshold Decision cannot be reached at the time the Project 
Appraisal Document/Activity Approval Memo or similar approval document is prepared; 
and, 
2) When USAID is not able to identify projects/activities or aspects of projects/activities 
prior to the authorization of financing. 
This document, in accordance with §216.3(a)(1), provides the required information necessary to 
issue a deferral of the required environmental review, including why the environmental review 
cannot be completed and the timing for completion of the review. Further it stipulates the 
requirements that must be implemented. Once this deferral is approved, the conditions and 
requirements of this document become mandatory. 

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Based on available information at the time of this IEE, there is not sufficient information to 
conduct a reasonable climate risk analysis. Climate Risk screening must be conducted as early 
as possible after award once the SOW and the interventions are well defined. No 
implementation of activities shall occur prior resolving the deferral determination and obtaining 
the approval of the BEO on the IEE amendment. 

BEO SPECIFIED CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL 

1. USAID/Libya will ensure the required IEE Amendment is completed in conjunction with the 
development of the first workplan. No implementation of activities beyond those needed to 
create the workplan are authorized. 
2. If the required environmental review cannot be completed in the designated timeframe (see 
IEE Expiration Date), an amendment will be prepared and approved with justification and 
with a revised timeframe.

3. USAID/Libya will ensure that appropriate language to carry out the requirements of this 
deferral is incorporated into relevant award documents, including requirements relating to 
development of the IEE or EA. Relevant award language shall ensure that implementation 
plans will be modified in accordance with the environmental review. 
4. USAID/Libya will (i) ensure an irreversible commitment of resources will be avoided until the 
environmental review is completed, and (ii) ensure appropriate environmental reviews are 
completed for incremental funding actions as subprojects/sub activities or aspects of 
projects/activities are identified. 
5. The CRM will be completed and incorporated into the IEE. 
6. USAID/Libya will clear this deferral with the ME BEO as part of the IEE Amendment as 
required by this document. 
IMPLEMENTATION 

In accordance with 22 CFR 216 and Agency policy, the conditions and requirements of this 
document become mandatory upon approval. This includes the relevant limitations, conditions 
and requirements in this document as stated in Sections 3, 4, and 5 of the IEE and any BEO 
Specified Conditions of Approval.

1.0 PROJECT/ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION 
1.1 PURPOSE OF THE IEE 
USAID environmental procedures require environmental review of potential impacts of USAID 
programs, projects, and activities. The environmental review can be deferred under two situations: 

1) When USAID does not have sufficient information for meaningful environmental analysis, 
and therefore a Threshold Decision cannot be reached at the time the Project Appraisal 
Document/Activity Approval Memo or similar approval document is prepared; and, 
2) When USAID is not able to identify projects/activities or aspects of projects/activities prior 
to the authorization of financing. 
This document, in accordance with §216.3(a)(1), provides the required information necessary to 
issue a deferral of the required environmental review, including why the environmental review 
cannot be completed and the timing for completion of the review. Further it stipulates the 
requirements that must be implemented. Once this deferral is approved, the conditions and 
requirements of this document become mandatory. 

While there is insufficient information to make a threshold determination at this time, this IEE 
provides critical information relevant to the operating conditions for consideration by prospective 
implementing partners of LEAP. 

1.2 PROJECT/ACTIVITY OVERVIEW 
Libya has experienced a lengthy conflict in the last decade and it is taking a heavy toll on the 
Libyan economy and the well-being of the population. The Libyan economy is highly dependent 
on the oil and gas sector and has a public sector that is large and inefficient. Oil accounts for 

around 
80% of 
Libya’s gross domestic 
product 
(GDP) 
and nearly all 
government 
revenue. 
The 

non-hydrocarbon related private sector share of GDP is very low in Libya and is expected to be 
hard hit by COVID-19, particularly the service sector (trade, transport), construction, and light 
manufacturing (agro-industries, handicrafts). 

Despite heavy over-reliance on public sector employment, only about half of working-age Libyans 
are active in the labor force, and the country suffers from generally high unemployment rates. As 
of 2017 there are an estimated 1.7 million Libyans on the public payroll, with salaries taking up 
more than the majority of the government budget. Youth and women unemployment, which has 
always been elevated, is particularly hard hit due to public sector fiscal constraints and a shortage 
of jobs in the limited private sector. This pattern is particularly troublesome because young men 
are at risk of recruitment into violent groups and/or illicit activities, due to un-or underemployment, 
poor quality education and youth exclusion on the one hand, and the attractions of militias in 
terms of income, power and security on the other. 

In the labor market, women are not allowed the same opportunities as men, which is reflected in 
their participation and employment levels. 2018 estimates of the female labor force participation 
rate are at a low 25.8%, compared to 79.1% for males.

of rainfall 
per 
year. 
Libya’s climate 
ranges from a temperate Mediterranean climate in isolated 
areas on the Mediterranean coast 
to a 
tropical 
desert 
climate 
in the 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
country’s 
interior. Because Libya does not have any major inland bodies of water, the Mediterranean Sea 
and the 
Sahara 
Desert 
are the 
most 
important 
features 
of 
Libya’s geography in 
determining 
climatic conditions, which include abrupt weather changes and sudden weather events across the 
country. The northern Mediterranean areas of Libya have dry summers and mild winters, with the 
majority of the precipitation falling in the winter. The highlands near Tripoli and Benghazi 
experience cooler temperatures and receive the most rain of any region in Libya. The interior 
desert experiences hot, scorching temperatures with extreme variation within a day. Rain is rare 
and irregular in these areas. The following summarizes the projected future climate data for Libya: 

• 
Mean annual temperature increasing by 2°C by 2050, resulting in more frequent heat 
waves and fewer frost days. 
• 
Increases in frequency of droughts, dust storms, sandstorms, and floods, along with 
increased desertification. 
• 
An expected 7 percent decrease in mean annual precipitation by 2050, with an increase in 
intensity of rainfall events. 
Agricultural will be most affected by climate change. Agricultural productivity is hindered by the 
limited renewable water resources, harsh climatic conditions, and poor soil quality. Only 3.8 
million hectares, 1-2 percent 
of 
the 
country’s area, can 
support 
crop 
growth. As a result of these 
constrained conditions, Libya imports around 75 percent of its food. Projected annual temperature 
increases of around 1.5-2°C are estimated to reduce crop yields by up to 30 percent by 2060. 
With an expected increase in both temperatures and number of drought days, agricultural draws 
from aquifers are likely to increase as well, and rain-fed agriculture and pastoralism may no longer 
be viable for the rural populations of semiarid Libya. Projected increases in the frequency of 
extreme weather events such as floods, sandstorms, and dust storms are likely to damage fields 
and irrigation infrastructure and further reduce crop yields. Salinization of soils due to sea level 
rise and floods is also expected to affect agricultural production. 

Libya’s water 
demand 
is far 
greater 
than 
its 
renewable supply. 
With only 
a narrow ribbon along 
the coast receiving more than 100 mm of rain per year, and frequent salt incursion into renewable 
aquifers, the renewable water supply is relatively small and of poor quality. The anticipated 
increase in annual drought days on the coast from the current 101 to as many as 224 within the 
next four decades is expected to also put significant stress on all water sources. 

With the vast majority of the country living in coastal cities (86 percent of the population), many 
Libyans are vulnerable to even slight 
sea 
level 
rise. Benghazi, 
the 
country’s second 
largest 
city, 
could face considerable damage with only 0.2 m of sea level rise. 

It is extremely important that the Implementing Partner must consider and factor in climate change 
during the planning stage of the interventions. The sum total of sand and dust storms, droughts, 
floods, and desertification present a larger-scale threat 
to 
Libya’s development 
and to its 
agricultural productivity. Although Libya is reliant on imports for much of its food, an increase in 
poverty due to damage to health and key infrastructure along the coast, combined with a collapse 
in domestic agriculture, could result in increased food insecurity and malnutrition.

Based on available information at the time of this IEE, there is insufficient information on the 
planned interventions to conduct a reasonable climate risk analysis. Climate Risk screening must 
be conducted as early as possible after award once the SOW and the interventions are more 
defined. No implementation of activities shall occur prior resolving the deferral determination and 
obtaining the approval of the BEO on the IEE amendment. 

5.0 CONDITIONS AND MITIGATION MEASURES 
5.1 CONDITIONS 
The environmental determinations in this IEE are contingent upon full implementation of the 
following general implementation and monitoring requirements, as well as ADS 204 and other 
relevant requirements. 

5.1.1 During Pre-Award: 
5.1.1.1 Pre-Award Briefings: As feasible, the design team and/or the cognizant 
environmental officer(s) (e.g., MEO, REA, BEO) will provide a pre-award briefing 
for potential offerors on environmental compliance expectations/responsibilities at 
bidders’ conferences. 
5.1.1.2 Solicitations: The design team, in coordination with the A/CO, will ensure 
solicitations include environmental compliance requirements and evaluation 
criteria. A/CO will ensure technical and cost proposal requirements include 
approach, staffing, and budget sufficient for complying with the terms of this IEE. 
5.1.1.3 Awards: The A/COR, in coordination with the A/CO, will ensure all awards and sub-
awards, include environmental compliance requirements. 
5.1.2 During Post-Award: 
5.1.2.1 Post-Award Briefings: The A/COR and/or the cognizant environmental officer(s) 
(e.g., MEO, REA, BEO) will provide post-award briefings for the IP on 
environmental compliance responsibilities. 
5.1.2.3 Workplans and Budgeting: The A/COR/EG team must prepare an IEE 
amendment to be submitted for BEO approval immediately after award upon 
receipt of the activity workplan to address the deferred Threshold 
Determination. No implementation of any activity prior obtaining BEO 
approval of the IEE amendment is authorized. Furthermore, the A/COR will 
ensure the IP integrates environmental compliance requirements in work plans and 
budgets to comply with requirements, including EMMP implementation and 
monitoring (if required). 
5.1.2.4 Staffing: The A/COR, in coordination with the IP, will ensure all awards have 
staffing capacity to implement environmental compliance requirements.

5.2.1 Sub-award Screening: The A/COR will ensure the IP uses an adequate 
environmental screening tool to screen any sub-award applications and to aid in 
the development of EMMPs. 
5.2.2 Other Supplemental Analyses: The A/COR will ensure supplemental environmental 
analyses that are called for in the IEE are completed and documented. 
5.2.3 Resolution of Deferrals: If a deferral of the environmental threshold 
determination was issued, the A/COR will ensure that the appropriate 
22CFR216 environmental analysis and documentation is completed and 
approved by the BEO before the subject activities are implemented. 
5.2.4 Positive Determination: If a Positive Determination threshold determination was 
made, the A/COR will ensure a Scoping Statement, and if required an 
Environmental Assessment (EA), is completed and approved by the BEO before 
the subject activities are implemented. 
5.3 MITIGATION MEASURES 
The Mission 
is 
planning 
to use the 
“Statement 
of 
Objectives” 
for 
the solicitation of this activity and, 
hence, the SOW and the anticipated interventions will only be well defined after partners submit 
their applications and an award is made. An IEE amendment must be prepared and approved by 
the BEO prior to implementation of any activity. Mitigation measures and conditions based on the 
accepted proposal shall be prepared and presented in the IEE amendment. 

6.0 LIMITATIONS OF THIS INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION 
To be incorporated in the upcoming IEE Amendment. 

7.0 REVISIONS 
Per 22 CFR 216.3(a)(9), when ongoing programs are revised to incorporate a change in scope or 
nature, a determination will be made as to whether such change may have an environmental 
impact not previously assessed. If so, this IEE will be amended to cover the changes. Per ADS 
204, it is the responsibility of the USAID A/COR to keep the MEO/REA and BEO informed of any 
new information or changes in the activity that might require revision of this environmental 
analysis and environmental determination
