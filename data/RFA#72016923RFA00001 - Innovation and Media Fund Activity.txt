SECTION A: PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 


This funding opportunity is authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as 
amended. The resulting award will be subject to 2 CFR 200 – Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and USAID’s 
supplement, 2 CFR 700, as well as the additional requirements found in Section F. 


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION (PD) 


A.1 
Purpose 
USAID/Serbia aims to support the establishment of an investment vehicle (the Fund) that will 
focus on financing innovative products and services in the media, information, and 
communications sectors in the West Balkans region. 


To do so, USAID will issue 
a 
Grant or Cooperative 
Agreement (in further text the Grant) 
to 
support a Fund that will make investments in products and services that directly or indirectly 
increase citizens’ ability to 
access information or 
increase critical thinking skills with a focus 
on, 
but not exclusively, 
to support: 


● 
small and medium-sized enterprises; new and existing 
companies that provide media, 
information and communications services; 
● 
industry stakeholders, including entrepreneurs, that develop supporting technological 
infrastructure and architecture, or increase innovation in the media, information and 
communications space for consumers and businesses; and 
● 
personal and organizational ability to safely and securely utilize digital technologies and 
platforms. 
USAID applies a holistic approach to supporting access to information. USAID will support a 
Fund that makes investments in a wide range of 
products 
and services 
including but not limited 
to those that 
are independent news and information 
providers, or provide cybersecurity, content 
analytics, subscription services, financial technology solutions (FINTECH), content management 
systems, audience measurement and analysis, information and communication platforms, 
educational tools; as well as applications that will utilize next generation technologies such as 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G technologies, and Internet of Things (IoT) and similar 
forward-looking products and services. These products and services 
must 
contribute to citizens’ 
ability to access accurate and relevant information, increase critical thinking skills, or 
support digital, media and information literacy education, and 
must 
adhere to the 
principles set below in the Section 2. Investment Principles. 


A.2 
Investment Principles 
Applications should incorporate the following guiding principles into the investment strategy:

● 
Support to freedom of expression and access to information in the public interest: 
The 
Fund will support media and other information products and services that contribute to 
freedom of expression and work in the public interest, directly or indirectly, and may 
come from a variety of industries and sectors ranging from media, information and 
communication platforms and related technologies, education, and/or are part of the 
emerging technology ecosystem such as AI, 5G and IoT. USAID expects that during the 
life of the Fund, a minimum of $16,000,000 of funds under management, inclusive of any 
operating costs that may be incurred by the Recipient in managing the fund, will be made 
available for investments to media, information and communication businesses who 
support, either through their products or services, freedom of expression and access to 
information in the public interest. USAID would welcome additional capitalization 
beyond $16,000,000 for investments that also support these objectives. However, the 
Fund may be designed to finance other sectors, including AI, 5G and Internet of Things, 
using capitalization beyond $16,000,000, in the interest of diversification and attraction 
of investors. During the implementation period, subject to agreement with the Recipient, 
this amount can be adjusted to reflect operational environment realities. USAID and the 
Recipient will hold regular, at a minimum yearly reviews that will address the optimal 
amount to be made available to media, information and communication service providers 
and products. 
● 
Ethical conduct: 
The Fund clients, specifically those 
that are 
information services, must 
adhere to the highest professional and ethical standards, including those set by the 
International Federation of Journalists, independent self-regulatory bodies like the Press 
Council, and similar professional organizations or subject to provisions of the 
international treaties like the European Charter on Human Rights1. Fund clients, 
specifically those focusing on 
technology products 
or services, should adhere to the 
relevant intellectual property rights, as well as incorporate protection of basic human 
rights, including privacy, freedom of expression and thought2, in development of their 
products or services. The Fund, and Fund clients, must adhere to principles of diversity, 
equity, inclusion, accessibility and gender sensitivity. 
● 
Focus on access to finance, product quality and clients’ growth: The Fund will support 
clients that have limited access to business development finance or investment capital, 
while at the same time have a high-quality product or service, sizable audience or market 
share, and a significant potential for growth.

A.3 
Specific Provisions for the Structure of the Fund 
USAID will provide a grant that will be invested by the Recipient, which will serve as a Fund 
Manager, General or Limited Partner in an investment vehicle (the Fund). The Fund will not be 
managed or controlled by USAID. 
USAID will not receive 
any income or profits 
from the 
grant and its investment in the Fund. 
USAID will not 
be acting as Limited Partner (LP) nor 
shareholder 
in the Fund. The Recipient will present 
to USAID its envisioned corporate structure 


(e.g. LLP, LLC or other). 
The USAID grant is intended to be used as catalytic capital to attract additional/third party 
investors to capitalize the fund. USAID’s capital investment will be capped at $8,000,000. 
This 
amount shall be inclusive of any operating cost that may be incurred by the Recipient in 
managing the fund. 
USAID funds will be allocated to 
the fund, at a rate calibrated to the pace 
of matching investments by additional/third-party investors until the above USAID investment 
capital cap is reached. The USAID grant may be used to support operational costs, as well as for 
equity investments, loans or mezzanine financial products. 


USAID does not expect the return of its grant or any income or profits after its involvement 
ends. USAID welcomes long maturity dates for any investments or loans supported with its 
grant. 


USAID does not require that funds from its grant will be drawn and invested on a pro-rata 
basis 
with other LPs or shareholders. 
It is acceptable 
to USAID that these funds be used to 
de-risk Fund investments 
(e.g. sole use of USAID grant 
funds for round one investment) in 
entities that fall under described Purpose. 


The Applicant will present USAID with a strategy and envisioned distribution of the USAID 
grant for operational and investment purposes. 


The USAID’s grant will serve to fully capitalize a Fund that serves the stated purpose (Section 1. 
Purpose) and incorporates the principles (Section 2. Investment Principles). USAID envisions 
full Fund capitalization of $32 million to be achieved within five to seven years. 


A4. 
Leveraged Funds 


The Recipient will be required to leverage additional funds for the project, by attracting third 
party capital investment. USAID expects the Recipient to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 1:1 
during the life of its cooperative agreement with USAID. As such,USAID expects the external 
leverage of no less than $8,000,000 in third-party investment for an initial minimum Fund size 
of $16,000,000 (including up to $8,000,000 in USAID funds). Please note that the minimal 
expectation is that USAID funds will be matched with external leveraged funds on a pro-rata

basis. USAID welcomes exceeding this minimum 1:1 leveraging requirement, and increasing the 
amount of external leveraging funding. 


USAID expects a minimum $16,000,000 over the life of the Fund to be reserved for investments 
in entities that directly correspond to the Fund's purpose (Section A1. Purpose of the RFA). 
USAID would welcome additional funds to be reserved for the Fund’s purpose. This amount 
would include the initial USAID $8,000,000 grant, and shall be inclusive of any operating cost 
that may be incurred by the Recipient in managing the fund. 


USAID strongly encourages the Recipient to further expand the fund with third-party capital 
investment, up to $16,000,000 for a total Fund size of $32,000,000. This additional funding 
could include direct financial contributions to the Fund, or third party investments or loans in/to 
Fund’s clients (e.g. investments or loans made directly in/to Funds’ clients by other investors, 
including other investment funds or banks, where the INNOVATION AND MEDIA FUND 
initial investments or loans acted as a catalytic or seed capital). 


Applicants can propose an investment portfolio that will focus on the sectors listed under Section 
A1. Purpose of the RFA, or can propose the inclusion of additional sector(s). Investments in any 
additional proposed sector outside the Section A1. Purpose of the RFA will be made with funds 
that are NOT included in the above minimum $16,000,000 requirement. 


Please note that the merit review criteria take into consideration the planned investment strategy; 
the planned distribution of investment portfolio between sectors that are listed under Section A1. 
Purpose of the RFA and any other additional sectors that the Applicant may propose; as well as 
the planned use of USAID grant for operating expenses (expressed as a percentage of the USAID 
grant, or as a fixed amount). For more information, please see Section E - Application Review 
Information. 


A.6 
Geographical and Currency Considerations 
The Applicant can propose the Fund's operating currency to be EUR, USD or other currency that 
may be the most appropriate for the Fund’s purpose, registration, and for other investors’ 
participation. The USAID grant will be made in USD, and the Recipient's financial reporting on 
USAID grant funds will be in USD. 


The geographic reach of USAID’s grant (e.g. Fund’s ability to utilize USAID grant for the 
investment or loan purposes) is the Western Balkan six (WB6) region countries (Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania), where USAID has 
current assistance programs.

Activity

Out of total funds under management, at least $16,000,000 million, inclusive of any operating 
cost that may be incurred by the Recipient in managing the fund, must be used within Western 
Balkan six (WB6) region countries, and Serbian based entities must be included in the Fund's 
investments. USAID would welcome additional funds to be dedicated to the WB6 region 
countries. 


If USAID’s grant is used for covering the Fund's operational costs, the Recipient must operate 
from the registered office in the Republic of Serbia. Notwithstanding the location of operations, 
the Recipient can choose a jurisdiction for the registration of the Fund best suited for purpose 
and to attract additional investors/ LPs.

hidden formulas or sheets. A PDF version of the Excel spreadsheet may be submitted in 
addition to the Excel version at the applicant’s discretion, however, the official cost 
application submission is the unlocked Excel version. 
Applicants must review, understand, and comply with all aspects of this RFA. Failure to do so 
may be considered as being non-responsive and may be evaluated accordingly. Applicants 
should retain a copy of the application and all enclosures for their records. 


4. 
Application Submission Procedures 
Applications in response to this RFA must be submitted no later than the closing date and time 
indicated on the cover letter, as amended. Late applications will not be reviewed nor considered 
at the discretion of the Agreement Officer. Applicants must retain proof of timely delivery in the 
form of system generated documentation of delivery receipt date and time/confirmation from the 
receiving office/certified mail receipt. 


Sample Language for email submission: 


Applications must be submitted by email to both individuals indicated in section D.1. Email 
submissions must include the RFA number and applicant’s name in the subject line heading. In 
addition, for an application sent by multiple emails, the subject line must also indicate whether 
the email relates to the technical or cost application, and the desired sequence of the emails and 
their attachments (e.g. "No. 1 of 4", etc.). For example, if your cost application is being sent in 
two emails, the first email should have a subject line that states: "[RFA number], [organization 
name], Cost Application, Part 1 of 2". 


USAID’s preference is that the technical application and the cost application each be submitted 
as consolidated email attachments, e.g. that you consolidate the various parts of a technical

application into a single document before sending it. If this is not possible, please provide 
instructions on how to collate the attachments. USAID will not be responsible for errors in 
compiling electronic applications if no instructions are provided or are unclear. 


After submitting an application electronically, applicants should immediately check their own 
email to confirm that the attachments were indeed sent. If an applicant discovers an error in 
transmission, please send the material again and note in the subject line of the email or indicate 
in the file name if submitted via grants.gov that it is a "corrected" submission. Do not send the 
same email more than once unless there has been a change, and if so, please note that it is a 
"corrected" email. 


Applicants are reminded that email is NOT instantaneous, and in some cases delays of several 
hours occur from transmission to receipt. Therefore, applicants are requested to send the 
application in sufficient time ahead of the deadline. For this RFA, the initial point of entry to the 
government infrastructure is the USAID mail server. 


There may be a problem with the receipt of *.zip files due to anti-virus software. Therefore, 
applicants are discouraged from sending files in this format as USAID cannot guarantee their 
acceptance by the internet server. File size must not exceed 25 MB. The size of each attachment 
is not limited as long as the total size of each individual email does not exceed 25 MB.

sub-awardee 
if any, by utilizing the provided budget 
template in Attachment 1 to this RFA. The 
Budget must be submitted as one unprotected Excel file (MS Office 2000 or later versions) with 
visible formulas and references and must be broken out by activity year. Files must not contain 
any hidden or otherwise inaccessible cells. 
Budgets 
with hidden cells lengthen the cost analysis 
time required to make an award and may result in a rejection of the cost application.The Budget 
Narrative must contain sufficient detail to allow USAID to understand the proposed costs. The 
applicant must ensure the budgeted costs address any additional requirements identified in 
Section F, such as Branding and Marking. The Budget Narrative must be thorough, including 
sources for costs to support USAID’s determination that the proposed costs are fair and 
reasonable. 


The Budget must include the following worksheets or tabs, and contents, at a minimum: 


● 
Summary Budget, inclusive of all program costs (federal and non-federal), broken out by 
major budget category and by year for activities implemented by the applicant and any 
potential sub-applicants for the entire period of the program. See budget template in 
Attachment 1 to this RFA. 
● 
Detailed Budget, including a breakdown by year, sufficient to allow the Agency to 
determine that the costs represent a realistic and efficient use of funding to implement the 
applicant’s program and are allowable in accordance with the cost principles found in 2 
CFR 200 Subpart E. 
● 
Detailed Budgets for each sub-recipient, if applicable, for all federal funding and cost 
share, broken out by budget category and by year, for the entire implementation period of 
the activity. 
The Applicants may propose a budget that will only include a management fee expressed as 
a percentage of the USAID Grant and total funds under management, or expressed as an 
annual lump sum. The management fee is expected to cover all direct and indirect costs 
incurred in managing and operating the fund (operating costs) exclusive of investments 
that the fund will be making. 


Alternatively, 
the Applicants can propose the budget 
that includes allowable direct and 
indirect costs, as well as amount planned for the fund's investments. 
In this case, the 
Detailed Budget must contain the following budget categories and information, at a minimum: 


1) 
Personnel/Salaries (if applicable) – Must be proposed consistent with 2 CFR 200.430 
Compensation - Personal Services. The applicant’s budget must include position title, salary 
rate, level of effort, and salary escalation factors for each position. The Budget Narrative

Innovation 
and 
Media 
Fund 
Activity 
in 
Serbia 


consistent with what is paid for similar work in other activities of the applicant. Applicants 
must provide their established written policies on personnel compensation. If the applicant’s 
written policies do not address a specific element of compensation that is being proposed, the 
Budget Narrative must describe the rationale for all costs and the supporting market research. 


2) 
Fringe Benefits and Allowances (if applicable) – If the applicant has a fringe benefit rate 
approved by an agency of the U.S. Government, must use such a rate and provide evidence 
of its approval. If the applicant does not have a fringe benefit rate approved, must propose a 
rate and explain how the rate was determined. In this case, the Budget Narrative must include 
a detailed breakdown of all items of fringe benefits (e.g., superannuation, gratuity, etc.) and 
the costs of each, expressed in U.S. dollars and as a percentage of salaries. Allowances, when 
proposed, must be broken down by specific type and by position. Applicants must explain all 
assumptions in the Budget Narrative. 
3) 
Travel and Transportation (if applicable) – Provide details to explain the purpose of the trips, 
the number of trips, the origin and destination, the number of individuals traveling, and the 
duration of the trips. Per Diem and associated travel costs must be based on the applicant’s 
normal travel policies. When appropriate, please provide supporting documentation as an 
attachment, such as company travel policy, and explain assumptions in the Budget Narrative. 
4) 
Procurement or Rental of Goods (Equipment & Supplies), Services, and Real Property 
(if 
applicable) 
– Must include information on estimated 
types of equipment, models, supplies 
and the cost per unit and quantity. The Budget Narrative must include the purpose of the 
equipment and supplies and the basis for the estimates. The Budget Narrative must support 
the necessity of any rental costs and reasonableness in light of such factors as: rental costs of 
comparable property, if any; market conditions in the area; alternatives available; and the 
type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased. 
5) 
Contractual (Subawards, Contracts and Consultants, as applicable) – If applicable, specify 
the budget for the portion of the program to be passed through to any subrecipients. See 2 
CFR 200 for assistance in determining whether the sub-tier entity is a subrecipient or 
contractor. The subrecipient budgets must align with the same requirements as the 
applicant’s budget, including those related to fringe and indirect costs. 
6) 
Other Direct Costs (if applicable) – This may include other costs not elsewhere specified, 
such as report preparation costs, passports and visas fees, medical exams and inoculations, as 
well as any other miscellaneous costs which directly benefit the program proposed by the 
applicant. The applicant should indicate the subject, venue and duration of any proposed 
conferences and seminars, and their relationship to the objectives of the program, along with 
estimates of costs. Otherwise, the narrative should be minimal. 
7) Indirect Costs (if applicable) – Applicants must indicate whether they are proposing indirect 
costs or will charge all costs directly. In order to better understand indirect costs please see 
Subpart E of 2 CFR 200. The application must identify which approach they are requesting 
and provide the applicable supporting information. Below are the most commonly used 
Indirect Cost Rate methods:

Method 1 - Direct Charge Only 
Eligibility: Any applicant 
Initial Application Requirements: See above on direct costs 


Method 2 - Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) 
Eligibility: Any applicant with a NICRA issued by a USG Agency must use that NICRA 
Initial Application Requirements: If the applicant has a current NICRA, submit your 
approved NICRA and the associated disclosed practices. If your NICRA was issued by an 
Agency other than USAID, provide the contact information for the approving Agency. 
Additionally, at the Agency’s discretion, a provisional rate may be set forth in the award 
subject to audit and finalization. See 
USAID’s Indirect 
Cost Rate Guide for Non Profit 
Organizations 
for further guidance. 


Method 3 - De minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) 
Eligibility: Any applicant that does not have a current NICRA 
Initial Application Requirements: Costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or 
direct costs but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this 
methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as 
a non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate an indirect rate, which the non-Federal entity may 
apply to do at any time. The applicant must describe which cost elements it charges 
indirectly vs. directly. See 2 CFR 200 for further information. 


Method 4 - Indirect Costs Charged as A Fixed Amount 
Eligibility: Non-U.S. non-profit organizations without a NICRA may request, but approval is 
at the discretion of the AO. 


Initial Application Requirements: Provide the proposed fixed amount and a worksheet that 
includes the following: 


● 
Total costs incurred by the organization for the previous fiscal year and estimates for the 
current year. 
● 
Indirect costs (common costs that benefit the day-to-day operations of the organization, 
including categories such as salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel 
administration, and accounting, or that benefit and are identifiable to more than one 
program or activity, such as depreciation, rental costs, operations and maintenance of 
facilities, and telephone expenses) for the previous fiscal year and estimates for the 
current year 
● 
Proposed method for prorating the indirect costs equitably and consistently across all 
programs and activities using a base that measures the benefits of that particular cost to 
each program or activity to which the cost applies. 
If the applicant does not have an approved NICRA and does not elect to utilize the 10% de 
minimis rate, the Agreement Officer will provide further instructions and may request additional 
supporting information, including financial statements and audits, should the application still be

under consideration after the merit review. USAID is under no obligation to approve the 
applicant’s requested method. 


e) 
PriorApprovals in accordance with 2 CFR 200.407 
Inclusion of an item of cost in the detailed application budget does not satisfy any requirements 
for prior approval by the Agency. If the applicant would like the award to reflect approval of any 
cost elements for which prior written approval is specifically required for allowability, the 
applicant must specify and justify that cost. See 2 CFR 200.407 for information regarding which 
cost elements require prior written approval. 


f) Approval of Subawards (if applicable) 
The applicant must submit information for all subawards that it wishes to have approved at the 
time of award. For each proposed subaward the applicant must provide the following: 


● 
Name of organization 
● 
Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) number generated from 
SAM.gov 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient does not appear on theTreasury Department’s Office 
of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient does not have active exclusions in the System for 
Award Management (SAM) 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient is not listed in the 
United Nations Security designation 
list 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient is not suspended or debarred 
● 
Confirmation that the applicant has completed a risk assessment of the subrecipient, in 
accordance with 2 CFR 200.332(b) 
● 
Any negative findings as a result of the risk assessment and the applicant’s plan for 
mitigation. 
g) 
SAM Requirements 
USAID 
may not 
award to an applicant unless the applicant 
has complied with all applicable 
SAM requirements and has obtained the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI). Each applicant (unless 
the applicant is an individual or Federal awarding agency that is exempted from requirements 
under 2 CFR 25.110(b) or (c), or has an exception approved by the Federal awarding agency 
under 2 CFR 25.110(d)) is required to: 


1. 
Provide a valid UEI number for the applicant and all proposed sub-recipients. 
2. 
Be registered in SAM 
before 
submitting its application. 
SAM is streamlining processes, 
eliminating the need to enter the same data multiple times, and consolidating hosting to 
make the process of doing business with the government more efficient (www.sam.gov). 
3. 
Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times 
during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration 
by a Federal awarding agency.

The registration process may take many weeks to complete. 
Therefore, applicants are 
encouraged to begin the process early. If an applicant has not fully complied with the 
requirements above by the time USAID is ready to make an award, USAID may determine that 
the applicant is not qualified to receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making 
an award to another applicant. 


SAM registration: 
http://www.sam.gov 


Non-U.S. applicants can find additional resources for registering in SAM, including a Quick 
Start Guide and a video on how to obtain an NCAGE code, on 
www.sam.gov, navigate to Help, 
then to International Registrants. 


h) 
Branding Strategy & Marking Plan 
The apparently successful applicant will be asked to provide a Branding Strategy and Marking 
Plan to be evaluated and approved by the Agreement Officer and incorporated into any resulting 
award 


i) 
Use of Proceeds From Sales of Equity Investments, Loan Repayments, and Other 
Income or Property Contributed by the USAID grant 
USAID will not seek the return of proceeds from sales of equity investments, loan repayments, 
and other income or property contributed by the USAID grant. The grant will not be returned to 
the USAID. These funds will be added to funds committed by USAID and the Recipient to the 
Fund, and used to further the Fund’s eligible purpose (Section 1. Purpose) and incorporate the 
principles listed under Section 2. Investment Principles. Alternatively, these funds can be held in 
an interest bearing account by the Recipient pending the determination of proper use of the funds 
in accordance with the agreement between the USAID and the Recipient. It will be up to the 
Recipient to propose its plan on how to best utilize these funds in order to further the Fund 
purpose. USAID reserves the final right to approve the use of these funds. 


After USAID’s involvement in the Fund ends, the Recipient will use all proceeds from sales of 
equity investments, loan repayments, and other program income or property contributed by the 
USAID grant, whether acquired before or after the termination of the award, towards activities 
that support and help develop the independent media, information, and communications sector 
stakeholders, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, startups and entrepreneurs that 
provide information or facilitate public access to the information, in line with the Fund’s purpose 
and investment criteria (explained under Sections 1. Purpose, and 2. Investment Criteria of this 
RFA). No later than two years after the award’s date, the Recipient will consult with USAID on 
the final use of the program income. USAID reserves the right to approve the use of the program 
income.

j) 
Conflict of Interest Pre-Award Term 
Personal Conflict of Interest 


1. 
An actual or appearance of a conflict of interest exists when an applicant organization or an 
employee of the organization has a relationship with an Agency official involved in the 
competitive award decision-making process that could affect that Agency official’s 
impartiality. The term “conflict of interest” includes situations in which financial or other 
personal considerations may compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, the 
obligations and duties of a USAID employee or recipient employee. 
2. 
The applicant must provide conflict of interest disclosures when it submits an SF-424. 
Should the applicant discover a previously undisclosed conflict of interest after submitting 
the application, the applicant must disclose the conflict of interest to the AO no later than ten 
(10) calendar days following discovery. 
Organizational Conflict of Interest 


The applicant must notify USAID of any actual or potential conflict of interest that they are 
aware of that may provide the applicant with an unfair competitive advantage in competing for 
this financial assistance award. Examples of an unfair competitive advantage include but are not 
limited to situations in which an applicant or the applicant’s employee gained access to 
non-public information regarding a federal assistance funding opportunity, or an applicant or 
applicant’s employee was substantially involved in the preparation of a federal assistance 
funding opportunity. USAID will promptly take appropriate action upon receiving any such 
notification from the applicant. 


k) 
Potential Request forAdditional Documentation 
Upon consideration of award or during the negotiations leading to an award, applicants may be 
required to submit additional documentation deemed necessary for the AO to make an 
affirmative determination of responsibility (such as, bylaws, constitution, articles of 
incorporation, travel, procurement, financial management, accounting manual, and personnel 
policies and procedures, especially regarding salary, promotion, leave, differentials, etc.) 
Applicants should not submit this information with their applications. The information in this 
paragraph is provided so that applicants may become familiar with additional documentation that 
may be requested by the AO.

4. 
Environmental Compliance 
(a) 
The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, Section 117 requires that the impact of 
USAID’s activities on the environment be considered and that USAID include environmental 
sustainability as a central consideration in designing and carrying out its development 
programs. This mandate is codified in Federal Regulations (22 CFR 216) and in USAID’s 
Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapters 201 
(http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/201.pdf) 
and 204 
(http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1865/204.pdf), 
which, in part, require 
that the potential environmental impacts of USAID-financed activities are identified prior to 
a final decision to proceed and that appropriate environmental safeguards are adopted for all 
activities. The Recipient’s environmental compliance obligations under these regulations and 
procedures are specified in the following paragraphs of this cooperative agreement. 
(b) 
In addition, the Recipient must comply with host country environmental regulations unless 
otherwise directed in writing by USAID. In case of conflict between host country and 
USAID regulations, the latter shall govern. 
(c) 
No activity funded under this cooperative agreement will be implemented unless an 
environmental threshold determination, as defined by 22 CFR 216, has been reached for that 
activity, as documented in the approved Request for Categorical Exclusion (RCE). 
(d) 
Request for Categorical Exclusion (RCE) 
DCN: 2022-SRB-TBD 
has been approved for this 
activity, see Attachment 2 to this RFA. It has been determined that the activity is fully within 
the class of Categorical Exclusions. As per 22 CFR 216.2(c)(2), neither an Initial 
Environmental Examination, nor an Environmental Assessment is required for an activity

which is determined to fall within one or more of the categories listed at 22 CFR 
216.2(c)(2)(i) education, technical assistance or training programs; and at 22 CFR 
216.2(c)(2)(iii) analysis, studies, academic research, workshops and meetings. 


(e) 
As part of its Annual Work Plan, the Recipient, in collaboration with the AOR and Mission 
Environmental Officer (MEO), shall review all ongoing and planned activities under this 
cooperative agreement to determine if they are within the scope of the approved Regulation 
216 environmental documentation. If the Recipient plans any new activities outside the 
scope of the approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation, it shall prepare an 
amendment to the documentation for USAID review and approval. No such new activities 
shall be undertaken prior to receiving written USAID approval of environmental 
documentation amendments. Any ongoing activities found to be outside the scope of the 
approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation shall be halted until an amendment 
to the documentation is submitted and written approval is received from USAID. 
(f) 
Subaward Provision: A provision for subawards is included under this award; therefore, the 
Recipient will be required to use an Environmental Screening Report (ESR) or 
Environmental Review (ER) checklist using impact assessment tools to screen grant 
proposals to ensure the funded proposals will result in no adverse environmental impact, to 
develop mitigation measures, as necessary, and to specify monitoring and reporting. Use of 
the ERF or ER checklist is called for when the nature of the grant proposals to be funded is 
not well enough known to make an informed decision about their potential environmental 
impacts, yet due to the type and extent of activities to be funded, any adverse impacts are 
expected to be easily mitigated. Implementation of the grants program cannot go forward 
until the ERF or ER checklist is completed and approved by USAID. Recipient is responsible 
for ensuring that mitigation measures specified by the ESR or ER checklist process are 
implemented. 
The Recipient will be responsible for periodic reporting to the USAID AOR, as specified in 
this award.
