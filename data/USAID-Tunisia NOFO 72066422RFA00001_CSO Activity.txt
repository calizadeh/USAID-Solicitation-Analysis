SECTION A: PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 


I. 
Program 
Goal 
and 
Objectives 
The 
overall 
goal 
of 
the 
Civil 
Society 
Activity 
(“The 
Activity”) 
is 
to 
empower 
Tunisian 
citizens 
to 
act 
and 
advocate 
for 
specific 
issues 
and 
effect 
change 
at 
the 
local, 
regional, 
and 
national 
level 
in 
advancing 
Tunisia’s 
development 
and 
to 
build 
thelegitimacy 
and 
sustainability 
of 
the 
civilsociety 
sector. 
Interventions 
will 
be 
focused 
on 
five 
to 
ten 
thematic 
areas 
decided 
through 
a 
participatory 
approach, 
over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
award, 
that 
reflect 
local 
priorities, 
political 
will, 
and 
strong 
potential 
to 
maketangible 
improvements 
in 
the 
daily 
livesof 
citizens. 
This 
activity 
has 
three 
main 
objectives: 


1. 
Increase 
the 
engagement 
and 
agency 
of 
citizens 
to 
act 
and 
advocate 
for 
specific 
issues 
of public interest. 
2. 
Strengthen 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
civil 
society 
organizations 
to 
promote 
positive 
change on citizen and constituent priorities (based on the organizational mission). 
3. 
Promote 
effective 
partnerships 
(intra-inter-and 
multi-sectoral) 
at 
local, 
regional 
and 
national 
levels 
(e.g., 
government,civil 
society, 
citizens, 
private 
sector) 
to 
act 
and 
advocate 
for specific issues of public interest. 
II. 
Background 
and 
Development 
Challenge: 
Country Context: 


Since 
the 
Tunisian 
Revolution 
in 
2011, 
civil 
society 
has 
gained 
increased 
political 
space 
to 
become 
established, 
implement 
activities, 
and 
advocate 
for 
reforms. 
The 
number 
of 
Civil 
Society 
Organizations 
(CSOs) 
post-2011 
doubled 
with 
an 
actual 
ratio 
of 
1.9 
CSOs 
for 
1,000 
inhabitants1. 
Of 
the 
twenty-four 
thousand 
registered 
CSOs 
per 
the 
latest 
IFEDA 
statistics, 
only 
six 
thousand 
CSOs 
at 
most 
are 
active. 
CSOs 
are 
over-represented 
in 
Tunis 
while 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
country 
continues 
to 
lack 
appropriate 
representation. 
The 
CSO 
landscape 
transformation 
involved 
a 
diversification 
of 
activist 
profiles, 
including 
youth 
and 
women, 
from 
urban 
and 
rural 
areas. 
CSOs 
are 
becoming 
more 
representative 
of 
the 
economic 
and 
social 
diversity 
of 
Tunisia, 
although 
the 
sector still remains predominantly urban and elite-driven. 


Problem Statement: 


During 
the 
post-2011 
period, 
CSOs 
have 
played 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
Tunisia’s 
post-revolution 
efforts 
to 
transition 
to 
a 
more 
participatory 
democracy 
and 
include 
citizens 
in 
decision-making. 
Civil 
society 
has 
played 
an 
important 
role 
as 
watchdogs, 
calling 
for 
government 
accountability, 
monitoring 
policy, 
and 
supporting 
civic 
education. 
However, 
CSOs 
are 
not 
always 
constituency-
based, 
they 
often 
are 
incentivized 
to 
respond 
to 
donor 
priorities, 
and 
their 
leadership 
can 
be 
hierarchical 
and 
personality-driven. 
CSOs 
have 
not 
entirely 
succeeded 
in 
embracing 
democratic 
values, 
mobilizing 
citizens 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
effectively, 
or 
advocating 
for 
change 
at 
local,

regional, 
or 
national 
levels. 
CSOs 
are 
also 
not 
always 
flexible 
or 
adaptive 
to 
address 
specific 
community 
needs. 
Tunisia’s 
2021-2023 
Open 
Government 
Partnership 
action 
plan2 
has 
identified 
several 
ways 
to 
increase 
public 
participation 
in 
government 
and 
for 
the 
government 
to 
embrace 
governance based on transparency and accountability. 


While 
Tunisian 
civil 
society 
organizations 
have 
flourished 
significantly 
since 
2011, 
covering 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
activities 
funded 
by 
various 
donors, 
the 
influx 
of 
funds 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
distortion 
of 
civil 
society 
efforts. 
Donors 
have 
noted 
that 
the 
sector 
has 
become 
weakened 
by 
the 
abandonment 
of 
smaller 
organizations 
for 
the 
larger, 
more 
well-funded 
organizations. 
The 
COVID 
crisis 
exacerbated 
the 
challenges 
and 
CSOs 
continue 
to 
shift 
their 
priorities 
to 
respond 
to 
immediate 
needs 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
government 
intervention. 
The 
2020 
Civil 
Society 
Organization 
Sustainability 
Index 
(CSOSI) 
highlighted 
that 
the 
political 
instability 
and 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic affecting the country in 2020 have both impacted the sustainability of CSOs in Tunisia.3 


Various 
CSOs 
lack 
the 
technical 
expertise, 
reporting 
skills, 
or 
legal 
knowledge 
to 
fully 
engage 
in 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
successful 
strategic 
plans. 
Government 
bureaucracy 
at 
every 
level 
creates 
hurdles 
to 
their 
work. 
Financial 
management 
remains 
a 
weakness 
in 
the 
CSO 
sector, 
and 
only 
a 
few 
CSOs 
have 
effective 
financial 
management 
systems. 
CSOs, 
particularly 
those 
in 
the 
interior 
regions 
of 
the 
country 
and 
along 
border 
areas, 
face 
significant 
financial 
obstacles 
and 
lack 
required 
technical 
skills, 
both 
of 
which 
disrupt 
their 
activities 
and 
their 
ability 
to 
operate 
effectively. 
The 
Center 
for 
Training, 
Studies 
and 
Documentation 
on 
Associations 
(IFEDA), 
serves 
as 
a 
center 
of 
resources 
and 
expertise 
but 
lacks 
thenecessary 
tools 
and 
resources 
to provide long-term and expansive capacity building to CSOs. 


Another 
set 
of 
challenges 
that 
was 
emphasized 
by 
CSOs 
during 
USAID 
consultations 
was 
the 
lack 
of 
coordination 
and 
resource 
disparity 
between 
“center” 
and 
“periphery” 
CSOs. 
Organizations 
based 
in 
Tunis 
or 
in 
other 
regional 
capitals 
are 
closer 
to 
policy 
and 
decision-making 
and 
are 
often 
better 
resourced, 
although 
Tunis-based 
CSOs 
also 
reported 
that 
sustainable 
financing 
remains 
a 
challenge 
for 
them. 
There 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
connection 
or 
network 
between 
CSOs 
in 
urban 
and 
peri-urban 
areas 
with 
those 
active 
in 
more 
rural 
areas. 
Tunis-based 
CSOs 
recognized 
that 
they 
were 
not 
effective 
at 
reaching 
out 
to 
smaller, 
nascent 
organizations 
in 
the 
outer 
reaches 
of 
the 
country. 
City-based 
CSOs 
identified 
the 
need 
to 
cross-pollinate 
with 
local 
groups 
and 
actors 
through 
peer 
exchanges 
and 
learning. 
While 
most 
national 
organizations 
comprehend 
what 
advocacy 
is 
and 
have 
engaged 
in 
several 
advocacy 
campaigns, 
CSOs 
in 
the 
regions have not fully embraced advocacy strategies for change at a local or community level. 


The 
political 
uncertainty 
of 
the 
post 
July-25, 
2021 
period, 
including 
the 
dissolution 
of 
the 
parliament, 
left 
CSOs 
without 
legislative 
counterparts, 
and 
increased 
their 
reluctance 
to 
speak 
out 
for 
fear 
of 
reprisal. 
While 
the 
current 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
environment 
for 
CSOs 
to 
operate 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
permissive, 
many 
experts 
are 
worried 
that 
changes 
to 
decree/laws 
will 
limit 
CSOs 
ability 
to 
operate 
effectively. 
The 
draft 
leaked 
version 
as 
it 
currently 
stands 
would 
likely 
limit association and international funding, forcing some CSOs to cease operations.

The

to 
empower 
Tunisian 
citizens 
to 
act/advocate 
for 
positive 
changes 
at 
the 
local, 
regional 
and 
national 
level 
in 
advancing 
Tunisia 
development 
and 
to 
build 
the legitimacy and sustainability of the civil society sector. 


The 
proposed 
activity 
aligns 
with 
the 
new 
draft 
CDCS 
Goal, 
“Foundations 
for 
a 
resilient, 
prosperous, 
and 
democratic 
Tunisia 
developed” 
and 
proposed 
Development 
Objective 
DO2: 
“Social

It 
will 
contribute 
directly 
towards

“Local 
communities 
empowered” 
This 
program 
will 
coordinate 
with 
other 
USAID 
programming 
in 
the 
CDCS, 
including 
the 
Political 
Transitions 
Project (PTP) and the Ma3an Activity. 


This 
effort 
will 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
USAID 
Draft 
Local 
Capacity 
Development 
Policy4, 
which 
is 
still 
in 
development, 
by 
shifting 
more 
leadership, 
ownership, 
decision-making, 
and 
implementation 
to 
the 
local 
peopleand 
institutions 
who 
possess 
the 
capability, 
connectedness, 
and 
credibility to drive change in their own communities. 


USAID 
is 
aware 
of 
the 
large 
interest 
from 
donors 
in 
the 
CSO 
space 
since 
2011 
and 
hopes 
to 
avoid 
similar 
types 
of 
past 
interventions 
such 
as 
deciding 
project 
themes 
without 
input 
from 
local 
citizens 
and 
groups, 
not 
enough 
money 
focused 
on 
local 
capacity 
development, 
too 
much 
generic 
capacity 
building 
support, 
and 
focused 
disproportionately 
on 
Tunis-based 
civil 
society, 
which 
have often not yielded lasting results. 


Other Donor-funded programs: 


While 
many 
donors 
and 
donor-funded 
projects 
have 
worked 
with 
and 
through 
civil 
society, 
the 
below 
mentioned 
program 
focuses 
explicitly 
on 
civil 
society 
strengthening. 
USAID 
encourages 
close collaboration between the Civil Society activity and any relevant other programs.

III. 
Objectives/ResultsandTheoryofChange 
A. 
Description of Results and their Relationship to the Objectives 
Throughout 
the 
activity, 
Tunisian 
citizens 
will 
be 
empowered 
to 
act 
and 
advocate 
for 
positive 
change 
on 
specific 
issues 
of 
public 
interest 
at 
the 
local, 
regional, 
and 
national 
level 
to 
advance 
Tunisia’s 
development. 
In 
addition, 
CSOs 
will 
be 
better 
equipped 
to 
build 
their 
legitimacy 
and 
sustainability 
to 
promote 
positive 
change 
on 
citizen 
and 
constituent 
priorities 
through 
strengthened 
institutional 
capacity. 
All 
the 
following 
objectives 
will 
work 
together 
and 
towards 
specific 
salient 
themes 
decided 
through 
a 
collaborative 
approach 
and 
themes 
that 
reflect 
citizen 
realities 
and 
needs 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
real 
impact. 
USAID 
seeks 
to 
address 
the 
funding 
and 
financial 
sustainability

facing 
CSOs, 
provide 
tailored 
capacity

resources 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
greater 
access 
for 
CSOs 
outside 
of 
Tunis 
and 
in 
the 
periphery. 
The 
recipient 
will 
increase 
effective 
partnerships 
(intra-inter-and 
multi-sectoral) 
at 
local, 
regional, 
and 
national 
levels 
(e.g., 
government, 
civil 
society, 
citizens, 
private 
sector) 
to 
advance 
shared 
development 
objectives. 
It 
will 
also 
increase 
the 
ability 
of 
civil 
society 
organizations 
to 
represent 
their 
constituents’ 
priorities 
and 
encourage 
the 
creation 
of 
more 
effective 
cross-sectoral 
partnerships in order to implement activities that drive active citizen participation. 


The 
recipient 
will 
promote 
citizen 
participation 
and 
ensure 
interventions 
are 
demand 
driven, 
and 
address 
issues/themes 
important 
to 
citizens. 
The 
activity 
will 
help 
partner 
CSOs 
become 
more 
inclusive 
by 
encouraging 
the 
participation 
of 
vulnerable 
and 
marginalized 
groups 
(including 
persons 
with 
disabilities, 
women 
in 
rural 
areas, 
youth 
in 
underprivileged 
communities, 
Black 
communities, 
LGBTQI+, 
ethnic 
and 
religious 
minorities 
and 
others) 
into 
civic 
activities 
and 
democratic 
processes. 
Also, 
the 
engagement 
of 
youth 
is 
paramount, 
as 
they 
were 
critical 
to 
past 
change efforts. 


Expected Activity Level Results: 


● 
Citizen’s perception of their ability to make changes to local problems improved. 
● 
Capacity 
of 
civil 
society 
to 
represent 
Tunisian 
priorities 
at 
the 
local, 
regional 
and 
national 
level enhanced. 
● 
Effective 
intra-sectoral 
partnership 
among 
local, 
regional 
and 
national 
level 
civil 
society 
organizations is promoted. 
● 
Long term sustainability of CSOs and the impact of their initiatives enhanced. 
Objective 
1: 
Increase 
the 
engagement 
and 
agency 
of 
citizens 
to 
act 
and 
advocate 
for 
specific 
issues of public interest. 


The 
recipient 
will 
increase 
the 
ability 
of 
civic 
actors 
to 
identify 
and 
provide 
viable 
solutions 
to 
local 
problems. 
Citizens 
will 
gain 
an 
understanding 
of 
how 
they 
can 
improve 
their 
local 
communities 
through 
locally 
driven 
approaches 
to 
identifying, 
addressing, 
and 
sustaining 
citizen 
initiatives. 
The 
recipient 
will 
build 
community 
assets 
and 
trust 
in 
civil 
society 
that 
can 
contribute 
to Tunisia’s overall democratic development. 


Expected Results 


a. 
Citizen feedback mechanisms developed at national and local levels. 
b. 
Citizen-driven civic initiatives empowered and increased. 
c. 
Effective local and national level civic issue-based advocacy campaigns implemented. 
Objective 
2: 
Strengthen 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
civil 
society 
organizations 
to 
promote 
positive change on citizen/constituent priorities (based on their own organizational mission). 


The 
recipient 
will 
improve 
CSOs’ 
ability 
to 
mobilize 
citizens 
and 
deepen 
relationships 
with 
constituencies. 
This 
activity 
will 
help 
CSOs 
ensure 
citizen 
buy-in 
by 
better 
identifying 
citizen 
priorities 
and 
solutions 
to 
their 
issues. 
The 
recipient 
will 
help 
CSOs 
better 
promote 
their 
activities, 
in 
addition 
to 
enhancing 
public 
knowledge 
of 
what 
citizen 
engagement 
is. 
All 
of 
these 
activities will increase the trust and legitimacy of CSOs among citizens. 



Expected Results: 


a. 
Civil society capacity to mobilize citizens and constituency building improved. 
b. 
CSO capacity to advocate for policy change improved. 
c. 
CSO communication strategies and public image enhanced. 
d. 
Funding sources for CSOs are diversified. 
Objective 
3: 
Promote 
effective 
partnerships 
(intra-inter-and 
multi-sectoral) 
at 
local, 
regional 
and 
national 
levels 
(e.g., 
government, 
civil 
society, 
citizens, 
private 
sector) 
to 
act 
and advocate for specific issues of public interest. 


The 
recipient 
will 
link 
organizations 
based 
in 
Tunis 
or 
in 
other 
regional 
capitals 
with 
peripheral 
groups 
and 
actors, 
and 
link 
private 
actors 
(civil 
society, 
private 
sector, 
citizens) 
with 
government 
actors to work on shared priorities. 


Expected Results 


a. 
Thematic 
issues 
are 
defined 
and 
addressed 
by 
CSOs 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
with 
inputs 
from 
local stakeholders. 
b. 
Engagement between CSOs, private sector and the Government are strengthened. 
c. 
Linkages 
across 
CSOs, 
especially 
those 
increasing 
center-periphery 
connections 
are 
strengthened. 
B. 
Development Hypothesis 
IF 
there 
is 
increased 
engagement 
and 
agency 
of 
citizens, 
AND 
capacity 
of 
civil 
society 
is 
strengthened, 
AND 
there 
are 
more 
effective 
cross-sectoral 
partnership 
among 
local, 
regional 
and 
national 
level 
civil 
society, 
government 
and 
private 
sector 
entities 
around 
shared 
development 
issues, 
THEN 
Tunisians 
will 
be 
able 
to 
advocate 
for 
specific 
issues 
and 
effect 
change 
at 
the 
local, 
regional 
and 
national 
level, 
AND 
the 
legitimacy 
and 
sustainability 
of 
the 
CSO 
sector 
will 
be 
enhanced. 


C. 
Assumptions 
USAID developed this Activity based on the following set of assumptions: 


● 
The Civil Society enabling environment remains open and permissive. 
● 
Stakeholders are open to collaborate with each other. 
● 
CSOs are willing and able to accept donor funding from USG. 
● 
Citizens 
will 
be 
willing 
to 
remain 
informed 
and 
willing 
to 
engage 
in 
creating 
positive 
change. 
● 
The security and public health situations in Tunisia remain stable. 
● 
The type of assistance provided is flexible and action-oriented. 
IV. 
Activity 
Parameters 
Inclusive Development/ Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) principles: 



Implementing 
partners 
must 
strive 
to 
incorporate 
the 
following 
principles 
into 
the 
design 
and 
measurement of activities: 


-Gender 
Inclusion: 
The 
2020 
Gender 
Equality 
and 
Women’s 
Empowerment 
Policy 
affirms 
USAID's 
vision 
of 
a 
prosperous 
and 
peaceful 
world 
in 
which 
women, 
girls, 
men, 
and 
boys 
enjoy 
equal 
economic, 
social, 
cultural, 
civil, 
and 
political 
rights 
and 
are 
equally 
empowered 
to 
secure 
better 
lives 
for 
themselves, 
their 
families, 
their 
communities, 
and 
their 
countries. 
A 
recent 
Tunisia 
gender 
analysis 
(February 
2022) 
showed 
that 
women 
are 
numerically 
well 
represented 
in 
elected 
and 
appointed 
governance 
institutions 
including 
leadership 
roles 
within 
CSO 
and 
as 
such, 
they 
can 
play 
a 
pivotal 
role 
in 
advancing 
gender 
priorities. 
However, 
Tunisia 
still 
has 
a 
long 
way 
to 
go 
to 
achieve 
gender 
parity 
in 
practice 
as 
cultural 
biases 
hinder 
the 
implementation 
of 
laws 
and 
regulations. 
The 
Recipient 
must 
systematically 
consider 
gender 
aspects 
and 
implications 
of 
specific 
interventions 
and 
seek 
opportunities 
to 
promote 
women 
participation 
in 
targeted 
interventions. 
To 
that 
end, 
data 
collected 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
purposes 
must 
be 
gender 
disaggregated 
and 
other 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
tools, 
including 
surveys, 
must 
include 
questions 
to 
elicit 
information enabling differentiation of impact based on gender. 


-Inclusive 
Development: 
Inclusion 
is 
one 
of 
USAID’s 
core 
values. 
USAID 
promotes 
a 
nondiscriminatory 
and 
inclusive 
approach 
to 
development 
that 
ensures 
that 
all 
people 
– 
including 
those 
who 
face 
discrimination 
and 
thus 
may 
have 
limited 
access 
to 
a 
country’s 
benefits, 
legal 
protections, 
or 
social 
participation 
(including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
LGBTQI+ 
people, 
persons 
with 
disabilities, 
religious/ethnic 
minorities, 
black 
communities, 
women 
and 
girls 
in 
rural 
areas, 
youth 
in 
underprivileged 
communities) 
– 
are 
fully 
included 
and 
can 
participate 
in 
and 
benefit 
from 
development 
processes 
and 
activities. 
The 
legal 
framework 
in 
Tunisia 
remains 
an 
impediment 
to 
the 
effective 
participation 
of 
LGBTQI+ 
individuals 
in 
public 
life 
as 
they 
are 
subject 
to 
high 
levels 
of 
state-sponsored 
persecution, 
with 
active 
arrests 
and 
imprisonment 
occurring 
under 
Article 
230. 
Though 
their 
rights 
are 
guaranteed 
by 
law, 
persons 
with 
disabilities, 
women,youth, 
religious 
and 
ethnic 
minorities 
and 
Black 
communities 
still 
face 
challenges 
accessing 
government 
services 
and 
being 
treated on an equitable basis with others in society. 


-Youth 
Engagement 
Policy: 
USAID’s 
Youth 
Policy 
outlines 
a 
conceptual 
approach 
to 
youth 
in 
development 
and 
provides 
guiding 
principles 
and 
operational 
practices 
in 
support 
of 
USAID’s 
efforts 
to 
mainstream 
youth 
in 
development, 
carry 
out 
more 
effective 
programs, 
and 
elevate 
youth 
participation. 
If 
youth 
and 
women 
continue 
to 
feel 
disassociated 
from 
the 
democratic 
government, 
and 
are 
unable 
to 
secure 
gainful 
employment 
and/or 
receive 
a 
living wage, then they will continue to lose confidence in Tunisia’s budding democracy. 


Implementation 
Approach: 
The 
following 
principles 
listed 
in 
alphabetical 
order 
must 
be 
considered in design and implementation. 


-Climate 
Risk: 
A 
climate 
risk 
assessment 
will 
be 
done 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Initial 
Environmental 
Examination 
before 
the 
award 
has 
been 
finalized. 
The 
activities 
implemented 
under 
this 
program 
will 
incorporate 
the 
current 
USAID 
climate 
mitigation 
and 
adaptation 
strategies 
where 
relevant 
and 
appropriate. 
The 
Recipient 
will 
submit 
a 
new 
climate 
risk 
assessment 
specific 
to 
this 
activity 
for 
USAID 
review 
and 
approval 
before 
major 
programmatic 
implementation begins. 



-Digital: 
Given 
the 
increasing 
challenge 
globally 
to 
fundamental 
freedoms 
online, 
the 
recipient 
will 
need 
to 
equip 
civil 
society 
and 
media 
actors 
with 
the 
knowledge, 
tools 
and 
resources 
to 
anticipate 
digital 
threats, 
tackle 
disinformation 
and 
protect 
the 
public 
against 
digital manipulation. 


-Flexible 
approach: 
It 
is 
critical 
that 
the 
Recipient 
maintain 
a 
flexible 
and 
adaptable 
work 
planning 
and 
monitoring 
system 
to 
account 
for 
and 
adjust 
implementation 
to 
unanticipated 
changes. 
Per 
ADS 
303.3.18, 
the 
AOR 
may 
approve 
revisions 
to 
the 
implementation 
plan 
to 
adjust 
for 
changes 
determined 
as 
a 
result 
of 
Collaboration, 
Learning 
and 
Adapting 
(CLA). 


-Local 
Engagement 
and 
Sustainability 
– 
Local 
engagement, 
participation, 
leadership, 
and 
country 
ownership 
are 
fundamental 
to 
the 
long-term 
sustainability 
of 
development 
outcomes 
and 
are 
core 
operating 
principles 
of 
this 
activity. 
As 
such, 
local 
partners 
and 
organizations 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
Activity 
and 
the 
recipient 
must 
work 
closely 
and 
collaborate 
with 
local 
partners 
on 
all 
phases 
of 
activity 
design, 
implementation, 
and 
evaluation. 
For 
further 
guidance 
on 
the 
vision 
please 
see 
the 
Draft 
Local Capacity Development Policy5. 


-Networking 
of 
actors 
and 
efforts: 
The 
activity 
will 
work 
to 
increase 
trust, 
coordination, 
collaboration, 
and 
cooperation 
between 
CSOs 
and 
civic 
groups, 
media, 
and 
the 
government; 
between 
the 
private 
and 
public 
sectors; 
and 
between 
donors 
to 
maximize 
and 
synergize 
efforts. 
The 
activity 
will 
aim 
to 
increase 
partnerships 
based 
on 
common 
development 
issues, 
but 
partnerships 
do 
not 
necessarily 
need 
to 
create 
permanent 
networks. 


-Private 
Sector: 
Integrating 
Private 
Sector 
Engagement 
(PSE) 
throughout 
the 
Program 
Cycle 
better 
positions 
USAID 
and 
partners 
to 
identify 
market-based 
approaches, 
mobilize 
private-sector 
investment 
and 
expertise, 
and 
make 
more-catalytic 
use 
of 
USAID’s 
resources. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
enables 
USAID 
and 
partners 
to 
adaptcontinuously 
to 
new 
evidence, 
opportunities, 
or 
circumstances. 
USAID 
envisions 
vast 
opportunities 
to 
engage 
with the private sector within this activity. 


-TargetBeneficiaries 
-TheActivitydoesnothaveaprimarytarget,butemphasisshouldbe 
placed 
on 
reaching 
organizations 
that 
are 
based 
outside 
of 
Tunis 
and/or 
that 
which 
have 
limited 
capacity. 
Civil 
Society 
Networks 
and 
pre-2011 
organizations 
must 
also 
be 
considered for this program. 


-Thematic 
Interventions: 
Interventions 
will 
be 
focused 
on 
specific 
thematic 
areas 
decided 
through 
a 
participatory 
approach 
that 
reflect 
local 
priorities, 
political 
will, 
and 
strong 
potential to make tangible improvements in the daily lives of citizens. 


-Thinking 
and 
Working 
Politically: 
The 
Recipient 
will 
continuously 
explore 
the 
local 
context, 
to 
adapt 
programming 
according 
to 
realities 
on 
the 
ground 
and 
opportunities 
and 
barriers that emerge. 


-Subgrants: 
The 
recipient 
will 
consider 
a 
significant 
set 
aside 
for 
small 
grants 
every 
year 
for 
local 
partners 
that 
could 
range 
from 
microgrants 
to 
core 
funding 
based 
on 
specific 
criteria 
to 
be 
developed 
jointly 
with 
USAID 
at 
the 
Workplan 
stage. 
The 
recipient 
should 
provide 
grants 
around 
themes 
or 
objectives. 
This 
will 
enable 
local 
sustainability, 
and 
shift 
more leadership, ownership, decision making, and implementation to the local institutions.

Collaboration, 
Learning 
and 
Adapting 
(CLA): 
USAID’s 
CLA 
approach 
ensures 
that 
USAID/Tunisia’s 
CDCS 
works 
as 
a 
living 
strategy, 
providing 
guidance 
and 
reference 
points 
not 
only 
for 
implementation, 
but 
also 
for 
learning 
and 
course 
correction 
as 
needed. 
Partners 
should 
apply 
USAID’s 
approach 
to 
CLA 
to 
this 
Activity. 
In 
alignment 
with 
ADS 
201.3.7, 
partners 
should 
integrate approaches to CLA that include: 


● 
Collaborating, where relevant. Collaboration activities may include joint work planning, 
regular partner meetings that facilitate knowledge sharing, and working groups organized 
along geographic or technical lines. 
● 
Involving USAID/Tunisia and other stakeholders in learning activities, such as portfolio 
reviews or stocktaking efforts, as appropriate. 
● 
Using the knowledge and learning gained from implementation, opportunities to reflecton 
performance, monitoring data, evaluations, knowledge about the context, and other 
sources to adjust interventions and approaches as needed. These practices will drive 
decision-making and activity adjustments in an intentional way that responds to new 
information and changes in context. 
Opportunity 
Response 
Mechanism 
(ORM): 
The 
recipient 
must 
set 
aside 
at 
least 
$3,000,000 
funds 
in 
an 
Opportunity 
Response 
mechanism, 
which 
may 
be 
used 
to 
respond 
to 
unanticipated 
needs 
and 
shocks 
produced 
by 
changing 
circumstances 
that 
are 
not 
included 
or 
envisioned 
in 
the 
Activity’s 
implementation 
plan. 
The 
ORM 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
available 
funding 
and 
identified 
opportunities 
and/or 
challenges. 
Both 
the 
Recipient 
and 
USAID 
may 
initiate 
an 
activity 
request 
under the ORM in the implementation stage. 


All 
ORM 
requests 
must 
be 
submitted 
for 
Agreement 
Officer’s 
approval 
and 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
Recipient’s 
separate 
budget 
and 
an 
activity 
description 
for 
the 
ORM 
activity(ies). 
All 
requests 
to 
utilize 
the 
ORM 
must 
contribute 
to 
attainment 
of 
objectives 
under 
the 
resulting 
Agreement. 
All 
activities 
under 
the 
ORM 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
substantial 
involvement 
provisions 
of 
the 
resulting 
Agreement 
and 
will 
require 
amendments 
to, 
included 
but 
not 
limitedto, 
the 
Recipient’s 
approved 
Activity 
Monitoring, 
Evaluation, 
and 
Learning 
Plan 
(AMELP) 
and 
annual 
Implementation 
Plan(s). 


If the ORM, or a portion of the ORM, is not utilized prior to the final year of the resulting Civil 
Society Activity Agreement, the AOR or the Recipient may request that the ORM be realigned 
into the standard program funding partially or in full, subject to funding availability and with the 
final approval authority of the Agreement Officer. Not all of the ORM must be used at one time 
and multiple interventions can be considered. Overall, subject to funding and identified 
opportunities and/or challenges, it is possible that by the end of the resulting Civil Society 
Activity Agreement, the ORM set-aside: (1) will be utilized in full, (2) will be utilized in part, or 


(3) will not be utilized at all. 
Programming Approach - Refine And Implement/Inception Phase 


New challenges or new opportunities arise regularly in Tunisia, and may arise between the design 
and launch of this activity. Typically, an implementation strategy and anticipated results 
established at the application stage will likely differ from the time of award. Implementers 



however may be constrained to carry out what was initially envisioned. In response to this 
tension, USAID will apply the new Refine and Implement (R&I) approach --similar to a “design 
and build” approach -- to this activity. This will enable the implementing partner(s) to carry out 
an initial five-month inception/refinement phase 
that 
should include political economy analyses 
and other sector or issue specific research and assessment components as well as the extremely 
important deep dives into communities, to identify community leaders, women-led, youth-led or 
youth-focused, and marginalized community leaders, groups, and/or focused organizations with 
whom to partner. As USAID requires more localization in all its awards, we recognize that the 
necessary relationships to truly localize and co-design activities in partnership with local 
communities, groups, leaders, and CSOs, takes time. This inception phase is that time. Recipients 
will account for this five-month inception/refinement phase within their year 1 work plan. 


This funding opportunity is authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as 
amended. The resulting award will be subject to 2 CFR 200 – Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and USAID’s 
supplement, 2 CFR 700, as well as the additional requirements found in Section F.

THE REMAINDER OFTHIS PAGE LEFT BLANK INTENTIONALLY. 



SECTION B: FEDERALAWARD INFORMATION 


1. 
Estimate of Funds Available and Number of Awards Contemplated 
USAID intends to award one cooperative agreement pursuant to this notice of funding 
opportunity. Subject to funding availability and at the discretion of the Agency, USAID intends 
to provide up to $25,000,000 in total USAID funding 
over the period of performance. 
This figure 
is inclusive of the $3,000,000 Opportunity Response Mechanism (ORM). 


2. 
Expected Performance Indicators, Targets, Baseline Data, and Data Collection 
The Recipient will employ a comprehensive and effective approach to monitoring, evaluation and 
learning (MEL), including evaluating the outcomes of program activities, documenting changes 
and achievements reasonably attributable to the program, learning and adapting from continual 
analysis and evaluation of data, and applying learning within the period of performance to 
increase the achievement of sustainable results. The Recipient will be required to work closely 
with USAID’s Monitoring and Evaluation Contractor and cooperate on data collection and 
verification. 


The Recipient will be responsible for developing and implementing an Activity Monitoring, 
Evaluation and Learning Plan (AMELP) aligned with expected outcomes of this program. In 
designing the AMELP, the Recipient is expected to (1) allocate sufficient human and financial 
resources within the program budget necessary for its successful implementation, (2) provide a 
clear description of methods to monitor and measure results, collect data and apply analysis and 
learning, and (3) ensure direct attribution of changes measured, as feasible. The AMELP is 
expected to facilitate flexibility in activity implementation to allow for course corrections and 
duplication of successful approaches. 


3. 
Start Date and Period of Performance for Federal Awards 
The anticipated period of performance is five years. The estimated start date will be January 6, 
2023. 


4. 
Substantial Involvement 
USAID will be substantially involved during performance of this Agreement as set forth below. 


4.1Approval of Recipient’s Implementation Plans 
The Agreement Officer has delegated the authority to approve implementation plans to the 
AOR. Accordingly, the AOR will review and approve the Annual Implementation Plan, 
including planned interventions for the current year and any subsequent years including 
revisions thereto. 


Approval of Risk Analysis and Mitigation Plan at the Workplan level: USAID recognizes 
that shifts in the local context can have implications for the achievements of results. 



Significant shifts may trigger adaption of the approach and indicators to better reflect the 
context. The Recipient, in close collaboration with USAID, shall undertake risk analyses 
not only to measure progress, but to test whether or not the assumptions continue to hold, 
providing USAID and the implementer with information to make key management 
decisions regarding the project. Additionally, the implementer shall refine, monitor, and 
report on risks as part of the Annual Progress Report. USAID will commission at least one 
external evaluation, either at mid-term or at the end of the project. 


4.2Approval of the Specified Key Personnel. 
USAID designated the following positions as key personnel. All changes thereto must be 
submitted for the approval by the Agreement Officer (AO). Any replacement Key 
Personnel must meet or exceed the requirements finalized at the time of award. 


Title: 
Name: 
Title: 
Name: 
Title:

4.3Approval of all sub-awards: 
The recipient must obtain AO’s prior approval of substantive provisions of proposed 
subawards (see definitions in 2 CFR 200). These would be provisions that go beyond 
existing policies on Federal review of recipient procurement standards and sole source 
procurement. 


2 CFR 200.308 requires the Recipient to obtain USAID’s prior approval by the AOR for 
the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under the agreement. Subawards 
included in the final revised application and budget are considered approved unless 
otherwise noted at the time of award. 


4.4Agency and Recipient Collaboration or Joint Participation: 
USAID has determined that the Recipient’s successful accomplishment of the program 
objectives would benefit from USAID’s technical knowledge, and has authorized the joint 
participation of USAID and the Recipient in the following ways: 


(1) 
Approval of recipient’s monitoring and evaluation plans: USAID’s involvement in 
monitoring progress toward the achievement of program objectives during the 
performance of the project, including written guidelines for the content of annual 
reports and final evaluations through AOR’s approval of AMELP. During the 
initial project planning period, the awardee will work closely with USAID to 
establish major milestones, program monitoring indicators, as well as baseline data 
and performance targets which will demonstrate successful achievement of the 
results addressed in the Program Description. 

(2) 
Communication with GOT Officials: The AOR must be present in all meetings 
with specified government officials, namely Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, and 
Directors at respective ministries. All communication with the above specified 
GOT officials must be made by the Chief of Party and coordinated in advance with 
the USAID AOR. Exceptions may be granted but must be in writing and made 
prior to any meeting/communication. 
(3) 
Selection of thematic issues to be addressed throughout the life of the activity. As 
the activity progresses, USAID and the recipient will decide jointly on the thematic 
issues that will be addressed and when. In the case of ongoing thematic issues, 
USAID and the recipient will determine when and if they will be retired. 
5. Authorized Geographic Code

designated as prohibited sources is found at 
http://www.usaid.gov/ads/policy/300/310mac. 


6. Nature of the Relationship between USAID and the Recipient 
The principal purpose of the relationship with the Recipient and under the subject program is to 
transfer funds to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation of the Tunisia Civil 
Society Activity which is authorized by Federal statute. The successful Recipient will be 
responsible for ensuring the achievement of the program objectives and the efficient and effective 
administration of the award through the application of sound management practices. The 
Recipient will assume responsibility for administering Federal funds in a manner consistent with 
underlying agreements, program objectives, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. 


7. 
Selection of Instrument 
The overall goal of the Civil Society Activity is to empower Tunisian citizens to act 
and advocate for specific issues and effect change at the local, regional, and national level in 
advancing Tunisia’s development and to build the legitimacy and sustainability of the civil society 
sector. Interventions will be focused on five to ten thematic areas decided through a participatory 
approach, over the course of the award, that reflect local priorities, political will, and strong 
potential to make tangible improvements in the daily lives of citizens. This activity has three main 
objectives: 


1. Increase the engagement and agency of citizens to act and advocate for specific issues of public 
interest. 
2. Strengthen the institutional capacity of civil society organizations to promote positive change 
on citizen and constituent priorities (based on the organizational mission). 

3. Promote effective partnerships (intra- inter- and multi-sectoral) at local, regional and national 
levels (e.g., government, civil society, citizens, private sector) to act and advocate for specific 
issues of public interest. 
It is the policy of the Agency to help countries meet their own local needs by providing Federal 
financial assistance to development actors who merit federal support or assistance by reason of 
their mission, programs, and activities in a Program Area for which the Agency has funding. 
Through the provision of the activities described in this Program Area, Federal financial 
assistance under a cooperative agreement for this Activity, the Agency intends to support 
development actors who will help achieve sector outcomes by carrying out their mission, 
programs, and activities in a manner that advances sustainable development in the Program Area 
and serves the Agency’s public purpose of supporting development actors who advance the 
achievement of USG development objectives in the Program Area.. 


The principal purpose of the Assistance instrument and the grantor-grantee relationship it will 
create between the Agency and the recipient is to transfer Federal financial assistance to the 
recipient - to carry out in the designated Program Area - a public purpose of support or 
stimulation, as authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and other 
applicable authorities as provided in annual appropriations legislation.

SECTION C: ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION 


1. 
Eligible Applicants 
Eligibility for this NOFO is not restricted. US and non-US organizations may participate under 
this NOFO. All applicants must be able to legally work in Tunisia. This includes having obtained 
any necessary registrations and permits to operate in Tunisia. 


USAID welcomes applications from organizations that have not previously received financial 
assistance from USAID. 


Faith-based organizations are eligible to apply for federal financial assistance on the same basis as 
any other organization and are subject to the protections and requirements of Federal law. 


Each legal entity is limited to one application under this NOFO as the prime Applicant. There is 
no limitation on being included as a potential sub-awardee across multiple applications. The use 
of exclusive teaming arrangements is discouraged. 


2. Cost Sharing or Matching 
Cost sharing is suggested (that is, voluntary) but not required. Cost sharing funds may be 
provided directly by the recipient; other multilateral, bilateral, and foundation donors; host 
governments; and local organizations, communities and private businesses that contribute 
financially and in-kind to implementation of activities at the country level. This may include 
contribution of staff level of effort, office space or other facilities or equipment which may be 
used for the program, provided by the recipient. For guidance on cost sharing in grants and 
cooperative agreements see 2 CFR 200.306. 


Applicants will not be graded favorable or unfavorably as a result of the cost share or leverage 
provided for in the applicant’s program. The Application will be graded purely on merit review in 
Section E of this NOFO. 


3. Risk Assessment: 
In accordance with 2 CFR 200.206 USAID is required to evaluate risk posed by the applicant 
prior to awarding a federal grant. Risk assessment will be conducted in accordance with ADS 


303.3.9. The Apparently Successful Applicant will be requested to submit additional evidence 
they deem necessary for the AO to make a positive risk assessment determination. The 
information submitted should substantiate that the applicant: 
i. 
Has adequate financial resources or the ability to obtain such resources, as required 
during the performance of the award. 
ii. 
Has the ability to meet the award terms and conditions, considering all existing 
prospective recipient commitments, both non governmental and governmental. 
iii. 
Has a satisfactory record of performance. Generally, relevant unsatisfactory 
performance in the past is enough to justify a finding of non-responsibility, unless 

there is clear evidence of subsequent satisfactory performance or the applicant has 
taken adequate corrective measures to assure that it will be able to perform its 
functions satisfactorily. 


iv. 
Has a satisfactory record of business integrity. 
v. 
Is otherwise qualified to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.

2. 
Questions and Answers 
Questions regarding this NOFO should be submitted to 
tunisiasolicitations@usaid.govno later 
than the date and time indicated on the cover letter, as amended. Any information given to a 
prospective applicant concerning this NOFO will be furnished promptly to all other prospective 
applicants as an amendment to this NOFO, if that information is necessary in submitting 
applications or if the lack of it would be prejudicial to any other prospective applicant. 


3. 
General Content and Form of Application 
It is recommended that Applicants review the full requirements in this Section before submitting a 
concept paper under this NOFO to ensure that you can meet all of the requirements listed therein. 
Reviewing these requirements will help you prepare for what must be done to increase the 
likelihood that your concept paper/application is successful. Applicants are expected to review, 
understand, and comply with all aspects of the NOFO. 


There are two (2) phases to the application under this NOFO: 


Phase I – Concept Paper 


A concept paper is a short document where the Applicant provides an overview of how you 
would respond to the NOFO problem description. During Phase One (1), the Selection 
Committee (SC) will review and evaluate the concept papers. The concept paper should be 
specific, complete and presented concisely. The concept paper 
must demonstrate a strong 
understanding of the context, the objectives set forth in the PD, and give USAID a high level of 
certainty that the applicant’s program will be a catalyst for transforming the CSO landscape in 
Tunisia. 
The Applicant should take into account the 
concept paper’s submission requirements and 
evaluation criteria found in this NOFO. Applicants should only submit the information and 
materials specified. Phase I concept papers will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Those receiving 
a “pass” rating will be invited to participate in Phase II. 


Phase II – Full Application 


Applicants who received a rating of “pass” from Phase I, will be invited to submit a full technical 
and cost application. Part of the Phase II submission will be an oral presentation as described 
below. 



USAID will review the full technical and cost application. After the Phase II reviews are 
concluded and discussions held, the Agreement Officer will notify the apparently successful 
applicant in writing. At this time the successful applicant will be asked to submit additional 
documents including Branding and Marking Plan, Program Description (PD) that is in line with 
its technical application, and other documents as identified by the AO. The final PD will be 
included in the award as SECTION B - PROGRAM DESCRIPTION. 


4. 
Preparation of Applications: 
Concept Papers and Full Applications must comply with the following: 


● 
USAID will not review any pages in excess of the page limits noted in this NOFO. Please 
ensure that applications comply with the page limitations. 
● 
Written in English. 
● 
Use standard 8 ½” x 11”, single sided, single-spaced, 12 point Times New Roman font, 1” 
margins, left justification and headers and/or footers on each page including consecutive 
page numbers, date of submission, and applicant’s name. 
● 
10 point font can be used for graphs and charts. Tables however, must comply with the 12 
point Times New Roman requirement. 
● 
Submitted via Microsoft Word or PDF formats, except budget files which must be 
submitted in Microsoft Excel. 
● 
The estimated start date identified in Section B of this NOFO must be used in the cost 
application. 
● 
The technical application must be a searchable and editable Word or PDF format as 
appropriate. 
● 
The Cost Schedule must include an Excel spreadsheet with all cells unlocked and no 
hidden formulas or sheets. A PDF version of the Excel spreadsheet may be submitted in 
addition to the Excel version at the applicant’s discretion, however, the official cost 
application submission is the unlocked Excel version. 
Applicants must review, understand, and comply with all aspects of this NOFO. Failure to do so 
may be considered as being non-responsive and may be evaluated accordingly. Applicants should 
retain a copy of the application and all enclosures for their records. 


5. 
Application Submission Procedures 
Applications in response to this NOFO must be submitted no later than the closing date and time 
indicated on the cover letter. Late applications may be considered at the discretion of the 
Agreement Officer. Applicants must retain proof of timely delivery in the form of system 
generated documentation of delivery receipt date and time/confirmation from the receiving office. 


Applications must be submitted by email to 
tunisiasolicitations@usaid.gov. 
Email submissions 
must include the NOFO number and applicant’s name in the subject line heading. In addition, for 
an application sent by multiple emails, the subject line must also indicate whether the email 
relates to the technical or cost application, and the desired sequence of the emails and their 
attachments (e.g. "No. 1 of 4", etc.). For example, if your cost application is being sent in two 



emails, the first email should have a subject line that states: "[NOFO number], [organization 
name], Cost Application, Part 1 of 2". 


USAID’s preference is that the technical application and the cost application (Phase 2) each be 
submitted as consolidated email attachments, e.g. that you consolidate the various parts of a 
technical application into a single document before sending it. If this is not possible, please 
provide instructions on how to collate the attachments. USAID will not be responsible for errors 
in compiling electronic applications if no instructions are provided or are unclear. 


After submitting an application electronically, applicants should immediately check their own 
email to confirm that the attachments were indeed sent. If an applicant discovers an error in 
transmission, please send the material again and note in the subject line of the email or indicate in 
the file name if submitted via grants.gov that it is a "corrected" submission. Do not send the same 
email more than once unless there has been a change, and if so, please note that it is a "corrected" 
email. 


Applicants are reminded that e-mail is NOT instantaneous, and in some cases delays of several 
hours occur from transmission to receipt. Therefore, applicants are requested to send the 
application in sufficient time ahead of the deadline. For this NOFO, the initial point of entry to 
the government infrastructure is the USAID mail server. 


There may be a problem with the receipt of *.zip files due to anti-virus software. Therefore, 
applicants are discouraged from sending files in this format as USAID/{insert Mission/Office} 
cannot guarantee their acceptance by the internet server. File size must not exceed {insert max 
file size}.

Subawards – Specify the budget for the portion of the program to be passed through to any 
subrecipients. See 2 CFR 200 for assistance in determining whether the sub-tier entity is a 
subrecipient or contractor. The subrecipient budgets must align with the same requirements as 
the applicant’s budget, including those related to fringe and indirect costs. 
6) 
AMELP-The Applicant must allocate sufficient human and financial resources within the 
budget necessary for successful implementation of the AMELP. 
7) 
Reports – The activity will require various reports throughout the life of the Activity as 
included in section F. The Applicant must allocate sufficient resources to generate these 
reports and to submit them in English language. 
8) 
Security – The Applicant must clearly identify security costs in the budget and budget 
narrative that demonstrates it has undertaken a thoughtful review of their security needs to 
successfully implement the Activity as presented in its technical approach. 
9) 
Environmental Compliance – The Applicant must include enough resources in the budget to 
ensure it can comply with environmental requirements for this Activity. 
10)Other Direct Costs – This may include other costs not elsewhere specified, such as report 
preparation costs, passports and visas fees, medical exams and inoculations, as well as any 



other miscellaneous costs which directly benefit the program proposed by the applicant. The 
applicant should indicate the subject, venue and duration of any proposed conferences and 
seminars, and their relationship to the objectives of the program, along with estimates of costs. 
Otherwise, the narrative should be minimal. 


11)Indirect Costs – Applicants must indicate whether they are proposing indirect costs or will 
charge all costs directly. In order to better understand indirect costs please see Subpart E of 2 
CFR 200. The application must identify which approach they are requesting and provide the 
applicable supporting information. Below are the most commonly used Indirect Cost Rate 
methods: 


Method 1 - Direct Charge Only 
Eligibility: Any applicant 
Initial Application Requirements: See above on direct costs 


Method 2 - Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) 
Eligibility: Any applicant with a NICRA issued by a USG Agency must use that NICRA 
Initial Application Requirements: If the applicant has a current NICRA, submit your approved 
NICRA and the associated disclosed practices. If your NICRA was issued by an Agency 
other than USAID, provide the contact information for the approving Agency. Additionally, 
at the Agency’s discretion, a provisional rate may be set forth in the award subject to audit and 
finalization. See 
USAID’s Indirect Cost Rate Guide 
for Non Profit Organizations 
for further 
guidance. 


Method 3 - De minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) 
Eligibility: Any applicant that does not have a current NICRA 
Initial Application Requirements: Costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or 
direct costs, but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this 
methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as 
a non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate an indirect rate, which the non-Federal entity may 
apply to do at any time. The applicant must describe which cost elements it charges indirectly 
vs. directly. See 2 CFR 200 for further information. 


Method 4 - Indirect Costs Charged As A Fixed Amount 
Eligibility: Non U.S. non-profit organizations without a NICRA may request, but approval is 
at the discretion of the AO 
Initial Application Requirements: Provide the proposed fixed amount and a worksheet that 
includes the following: 


● 
Total costs incurred by the organization for the previous fiscal year and estimates for the 
current year. 
● 
Indirect costs (common costs that benefit the day-to-day operations of the organization, 
including categories such as salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel 
administration, and accounting, or that benefit and are identifiable to more than one 
program or activity, such as depreciation, rental costs, operations and maintenance of 
facilities, and telephone expenses) for the previous fiscal year and estimates for the current 
year 

● 
Proposed method for prorating the indirect costs equitably and consistently across all 
programs and activities of using a base that measures the benefits of that particular cost to 
each program or activity to which the cost applies. 
If the applicant does not have an approved NICRA and does not elect to utilize the 10% de 
minimis rate, the Agreement Officer will provide further instructions and may request additional 
supporting information, including financial statements and audits, should the application still be 
under consideration after the merit review. USAID is under no obligation to approve the 
applicant’s requested method. 


12)Cost Sharing – The applicant should estimate the amount of cost-sharing resources to be 
provided over the life of the agreement and specify the sources of such resources, and the basis 
of calculation in the budget narrative. Applicants should also provide a breakdown of the cost 
share (financial and in-kind contributions) of all organizations involved in implementing the 
resulting award. 


d) 
PriorApprovals in accordance with 2 CFR 200.407 
Inclusion of an item of cost in the detailed application budget does not satisfy any requirements 
for prior approval by the Agency. If the applicant would like the award to reflect approval of any 
cost elements for which prior written approval is specifically required for allowability, the 
applicant must specify and justify that cost. See 2 CFR 200.407 for information regarding which 
cost elements require prior written approval. 


e) Approval of Subawards 
The applicant must submit information for all subawards that it wishes to have approved at the 
time of award. For each proposed subaward the applicant must provide the following: 


● 
Name of organization 
● 
Unique Entity Identity Number 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient does not appear on the Treasury Department’s Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient does not have active exclusions in the System for 
Award Management (SAM) 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient is not listed in the United Nations Security designation 
list 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient is not suspended or debarred 
● 
Confirmation that the applicant has completed a risk assessment of the subrecipient, in 
accordance with 2 CFR 200.332(b) 
● 
Any negative findings as a result of the risk assessment and the applicant’s plan for 
mitigation. 
e) 
Unique Entity Identifier and SAM Requirements 

USAID may not award to an applicant unless the applicant has complied with all applicable 
unique entity identifier (UEI) and System for Award Management (SAM) requirements. 


As of April 4, 2022, the nine-digit “DUNS number” or Data Universal Numbering System 
number, will not longed be used in federal systems, and a new 12-digit alphanumeric code will 
take its place: the new Unique Entity ID will be the official governmentwide identifier used for 
federal awards. 


Each applicant (unless the applicant is an individual or Federal awarding agency that is exempted 
from requirements under 2 CFR 25.110(b) or (c), or has an exception approved by the Federal 
awarding agency under 2 CFR 25.110(d)) is required to: 


1. 
Provide a Unique Entity ID assigned by Sam.gov for the applicant and all proposed 
sub-recipients; 
2. 
Be registered in SAM 
before 
submitting its application. 
SAM is streamlining processes, 
eliminating the need to enter the same data multiple times, and consolidating hosting to 
make the process of doing business with the government more efficient (www.sam.gov 
). 
3. 
Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times 
during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration 
by a Federal awarding agency. 
The registration process may take many weeks to complete. 
Therefore, applicants are encouraged 
to begin the process early. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements above by 
the time USAID is ready to make an award, USAID may determine that the applicant is not 
qualified to receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another 
applicant. 


SAM registration: 
http://www.sam.gov 


Non-U.S. applicants can find additional resources for registering in SAM, including a Quick Start 
Guide and a video on how to obtain an NCAGE code, on 
www.sam.gov 
, navigate to Help, then 
to International Registrants. 


f) 
History of Performance 
In order to perform a responsibility determination and risk assessment, the Agreement Officer 
may ask for additional performance history on top of what is requested in Section D. If requested, 
the applicant shall provide information regarding its recent history of performancefor all its 
cost-reimbursement contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements involving similar or related 
programs, not to exceed 5, 
as follows: 


• Name of the Awarding Organization; 
•Award Number; 
•Activity Title; 
•A brief description of the activity; 
• Period of Performance; 
•Award Amount; 

• Reports and findings from any audits performed in the last 5; and 
• Name of at least two (2) updated professional contacts who most directly observed the work at 
the organization for which the service was performed with complete current contact information 
including telephone number, and e-mail address for each proposed individual. 
If the applicant encountered problems on any of the referenced Awards, it may provide a short 
explanation and the corrective action taken. The applicant should not provide general information 
on its performance. USAID reserves the right to obtain relevant information concerning an 
applicant’s history of performance from any sources and may consider such information in its 
review of the applicant’s risk. The Agency may request additional information and conduct a 
pre-award survey if it determines that it is necessary to inform the risk assessment. 


g) 
Branding Strategy & Marking Plan 
The apparently successful applicant will be asked to provide a Branding Strategy and Marking 
Plan to be evaluated and approved by the Agreement Officer and incorporated into any resulting 
award 


Branding Strategy – Assistance (June 2012) 


a.Applicants recommended for an assistance award must submit and negotiate a "Branding 
Strategy," describing how the program, project, or activity is named and positioned, and how it is 
promoted and communicated to beneficiaries and host country citizens. 
b. The request for a Branding Strategy, by the Agreement Officer from the Applicant, 
confers no rights to the Applicant and constitutes no USAID commitment to an award. 
c. Failure to submit and negotiate a Branding Strategy within the time frame specified by 
the Agreement Officer will make the Applicant ineligible for an award. 
d. The Applicant must include all estimated costs associated with branding and marking 
USAID programs, such as plaques, stickers, banners, press events, materials, and so 
forth, in the budget portion of the application. These costs are subject to the revision

v. USAID prefers to fund projects that do not have a separate logo or identity that 
competes with the USAID Identity. If there is a plan to develop a separate logo to 
consistently identify this program, the Applicant must attach a copy of the 
proposed logos. Section VI of the RFA or APS will state if an Administrator 
approved the use of an additional or substitute logo, seal, or tagline. 
3. The intended primary and secondary audiences for this project or program, including 
direct beneficiaries and any special target segments. 
4. Planned communication or program materials used to explain or market the program to

detailing the public communications, commodities, and program materials, and other items that 
will visibly bear the “USAID Identity,” which comprises of the USAID logo and brand mark, 
with the tagline “from the American people.” The USAID Identity is the official marking for the 
Agency and is found on the USAID Web site at http://www.usaid.gov/branding. Section VI of the 
RFA or APS will state if an Administrator approved the use of an additional or substitute logo, 
seal, or tagline. 
b. The request for a Marking Plan, by the Agreement Officer from the Applicant, confers no 
rights to the Applicant and constitutes no USAID commitment to an award.

Agreement Officer will make the Applicant ineligible for an award. 
d. The Applicant must include all estimated costs associated with branding and marking USAID 
programs, such as plaques, stickers, banners, press events, materials, and so forth, in the budget 
portion of the application. These costs are subject to the revision and negotiation with the

USAID identity , and 
v. The rationale for not marking program deliverables. 
3.Any requests for an exemption from USAID marking requirements, and an explanation 
of why the exemption would apply. The Applicant may request an exemption if USAID 
marking requirements would: 
i.Compromise the intrinsic independence or neutrality of a program or materials 
where independence or neutrality is an inherent aspect of the program and 
materials. The Applicant must identify the USAID Development Objective, 
Interim Result, or program goal furthered by an appearance of neutrality, or state 
why an aspect of the award is presumptively neutral. Identify by category or 
deliverable item, examples of material for which an exemption is sought.

public service announcements, or other communications. The Applicant must 
explain why each particular item or product is better positioned as host country 
government item or product. 

iv. Impair the functionality of an item. The Applicant must explain how marking 
the item or commodity would impair its functionality. 
v. Incur substantial costs or be impractical. The Applicant must explain why 
marking would not be cost beneficial or practical. 
vi. Offend local cultural or social norms or be considered inappropriate. The 
Applicant must identify the relevant norm and explain why marking would violate 
that norm or otherwise be inappropriate. 
vii. Conflict with international law. The Applicant must identify the applicable 
international law violated by the marking. 
f. The Agreement Officer will consider the Marking Plan's adequacy and reasonableness 
and will approve or disapprove any exemption requests. The Marking Plan will be

the stated objectives of the award, the Applicant's cost data submissions, and the 
performance plan. 
g. If the Applicant receives an assistance award, the Marking Plan, including any 
approved exemptions, will be included in, and made part of the resulting grant or 
cooperative agreement, and will apply for the term of the award unless provided 
otherwise. 
h) 
Funding Restrictions

i) 
Conflict of Interest Pre-Award Term (August 2018) 
1. Personal Conflict of Interest 
a.An actual or appearance of a conflict of interest exists when an Applicant organization 
or an employee of the organization has a relationship with an Agency official involved 
in the competitive award decision-making process that could affect that Agency

financial or other personal considerations may compromise, or have the appearance of 
compromising, the obligations and duties of a USAID employee or Recipient 
employee. 


b. The Applicant must provide conflict of interest disclosures when it submits an SF-424. 
If the Applicant discovers a previously undisclosed conflict of interest after submitting

than ten (10) calendar days following discovery. 
2. Organizational Conflict of Interest 
The Applicant must notify USAID of any actual or potential conflict of interest that 
they are aware of that may provide the Applicant with an unfair competitive 
advantage in competing for this financial assistance award. Examples of an unfair 
competitive advantage include but are not limited to situations in which an Applicant 
or the Applicant’s employee gained access to non-public information regarding a 
federal assistance funding opportunity, or an Applicant or Applicant’s employee was 
substantially involved in the preparation of a federal assistance funding opportunity. 
USAID will promptly take appropriate action upon receiving any such notification 
from the Applicant.

Business Review 
The Agency will evaluate the cost application of the applicant(s) under consideration for an award 
as a result of the merit criteria review to determine whether the costs are allowable in accordance 
with the cost principles found in 2 CFR 200 Subpart E. 


The Agency will also consider (1) the extent of the applicant's understanding of the financial 
aspects of the program and the applicant's ability to perform the activities within the amount 
requested; (2) whether the applicant's plans will achieve the program objectives with reasonable 
economy and efficiency; and (3) whether any special conditions relating to costs should be

The AO will perform a risk assessment (2 CFR 200.206). The AO may determine that a 
pre-award survey is required to inform the risk assessment in determining whether the prospective 
recipient has the necessary organizational, experience, accounting and operational controls, 
financial resources, and technical skills – or ability to obtain them – in order to achieve the 
objectives of the program and comply with the terms and conditions of the award. Depending on 
the result of the risk assessment, the AO will decide to execute the award, not execute the award, 
or award with “specific conditions” (2 CFR 200.208).

Performance Reporting 
(a) 
Annual Implementation Plans 
The annual implementation plans for all USAID/Tunisia awards are aligned with the USG Fiscal 
Year Calendar (October 1 to September 30). The Recipient will submit its first implementation 
plan to the AOR for approval within 45 days of Award. The first implementation plan will cover 
the period from the start date of the Award until the end of the inception period. first USG Fiscal 
Year of the Activity – therefore the first implementation plan may cover less than twelve months 
depending on the date of Award, and will cover the inception period of the award. The AOR will 
provide comments within 10 working days to the Recipient and the Recipient will have 10 
working days to respond and make all requested changes, after which the AOR will provide final 
approval within 10 working days. 


All subsequent implementation plans will be submitted to the AOR no later than August 15 and 
will cover an entire Fiscal Year, i.e. October 1 to September 30. The AOR will provide comments 
within approximately 10 working days to the Recipient and the Recipient will have approximately 
10 working days to respond and make all requested changes, after which the AOR will provide 
final approval within approximately 10 working days. All work plans must be developed in 
cooperation with the AOR, other USAID/Jordan activities, other relevant donor programs, 
relevant GoJ ministries, and all other relevant stakeholders as designated by the AOR. 


(b) 
Activity Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL) Plan 
As per ADS 201, the Recipient is required to submit for AOR approval an Activity Monitoring, 
Evaluation & Learning (AMEL) Plan for the life of the Activity based on its proposed 



monitoring, evaluation and Learning (MEL) strategy for collecting, evaluating and validating data 
which will be used to measure overall progress towards Mission goals. The draft AMEL Plan is 
due to the AOR within 90 days of the award. In-line with learning and adapting, the Recipient and 
the AOR will review the AMEL Plan for any needed changes during the Annual Implementation 
Plan process. All aspects of the AMEL Plan should be in line with USAID’s ADS 201 on 
assessing and learning and adhere to the following: 


● 
Activities must have an approved AMEL Plan in place before major implementation 
actions begin. The AOR will work with the Recipient and the Mission’s M&E 
Specialist(s) to ensure that the AMEL Plan is consistent with, and meets the data 
collection needs of the Mission’s Performance Management Plan (PMP), the Mission’s 
annual Performance Plan and Report (PPR) and other reporting, as required. 
● 
The AMEL Plan should include a narrative that clearly articulates the activity’s theory of 
change, describing the causal and logical relationships between different levels of results, 
along with the associated interventions, indicators and other performance data, and critical 
assumptions under each result. The AMEL Plan should also present a logic model that 
illustrates these results, the causal and logical relationships between them, and the 
indicator and other performance data required to measure each. 
● 
The AMEL Plan should include approaches for a systematic, intentional and resourced 
approach to a strategic collaboration, continuous learning and adaptive management. In 
developing the MEL Plan, the Recipient should identify and describe: learning objectives 
with corresponding information needs and learning activities/research; strategic 
opportunities to “pause and reflect” and coordinate and collaborate with stakeholders; 
approaches for regular learning to address the identified learning objectives; plans for 
documenting the knowledge and learning from these opportunities, and disseminating 
findings; resources (financial and human resources as well as tools) needed to implement 
learning approaches; and, approaches to adapting/adjusting implementation and 
programming as a result of this learning. 
● 
The Recipient will develop performance indicators and establish baselines and targets for 
output, outcome, and impact level monitoring, as well as benchmarks for performance 
over the life of the activity. The AMEL Plan should also contain metrics for the 
sustainability of successful interventions introduced with activity support. The AOR will 
provide a list of Mission PMP indicators required for the activity. The AMEL Plan must 
include the required Mission PMP indicators along with any others being proposed by the 
Recipient that are deemed necessary or useful in measuring progress against the overall 
goal and objective(s). Selected indicators should be a combination of performance and 
context indicators. Recipients should be strategic in their selection of additional indicators 
to ensure an appropriate balance between required data and the resource costs of data 
collection, analysis and reporting. The AMEL Plan must include fiscal year - quarterly 
and/or annual targets, as per the indicator requirements, necessary to reach the life of 
project targets identified by the Mission for required Mission indicators and identified by 

the Recipient for all other indicators. USAID criteria for selecting performance indicators 
is that they be direct, objective, practical, adequate, management useful and reflect 
progress toward achieving results, and, to the extent possible, be attributable to USAID. 
Performance data must meet reasonable quality criteria of validity, reliability, timeliness, 
precision and integrity. The Recipient and USAID will agree upon the final choice of 
performance indicators useful for timely management decisions and credibly reflecting the 
actual performance of the activity. 


● 
USAID/Tunisia may require the Recipient to track and report on additional performance 
indicators subject to changing of Agency guidance and/or the requirements of specific 
funding sources and the Mission’s own Performance Management Plan (PMP). 
● 
The Recipient must collect, analyze, and submit to USAID data disaggregated by sex and 
geographic location as applicable. To ensure that USAID assistance makes the maximum 
optimal contribution to gender equality, performance management systems and 
evaluations must include gender-sensitive indicators and sex-disaggregated data when 
applicable and feasible; M&E plans should also capture proposed actions that will address 
any identified gender-related issues. Geographic disaggregation is required to the first 
administrative level at a minimum; in Jordan this corresponds to the governorate level. 
The Recipient should also consider including other relevant disaggregations for indicators 
– for example, age and type of institution. 
● 
The AMEL Plan must also include, in consultation with USAID, agreed-upon planned 
internal and external evaluations and evaluation questions that are salient to the 
implementation, adaptation or review of the activity in line with the USAID Evaluation 
Policy. The AMEL Plan should demonstrate how the timing and content of evaluations 
and questions will: help clarify and focus activity objectives; serve as an early warning 
system, forecasting, and reporting tool; promote on-going discussions pertaining to 
activity scope and direction; and, aid in effective management and decision making 
● 
The MEL Plan must also include an explanation of the monitoring approach and estimated 
resources required to successfully implement the MEL Plan. This will be done through 
describing the Recipient’s M&E system, including policies and procedures for how data 
and information will be collected, analyzed, and used; methodology of establishing 
baselines and targets; staffing/expertise, roles and responsibilities for the management and 
implementation of the MEL Plan; systems (automated or other) where data will be 
collected and stored; resources for M&E functions; procedures for communicating with 
USAID; means of adapting and learning; schedule for M&E functions, such as reporting 
performance data, assessing progress and making adjustments if needed; etc. 
(c) 
Risk Analysis and Mitigation Plan: 
USAID recognizes that shifts in the local context can have implications for the achievements of 
results. Significant shifts may trigger adaption of the approach and indicators to better reflect the 
context. The implementer, in close collaboration with USAID, shall undertake risk analyses not 
only to measure progress, but to test whether or not the assumptions continue to hold, providing 
USAID and the implementer with information to make key management decisions regarding the 



project. After the initial Risk Analysis and Mitigation Plan is developed 90 day after the award 
has been made, the recipient shall refine, monitor, and report on risks as part of the Annual 
Progress Report. 


(d) Quarterly Performance Reports 
Thirty (30) days after the end of each USG fiscal year quarter, the Recipient will provide quarterly 
performance reports (in accordance with 2 CFR 200.328 (b) (1)) to describe activities undertaken; 
report on progress made toward achieving results, and make necessary adjustments for activities 
that will be undertaken in the next quarter. The report must be brief yet precise, description of the 
activities, with emphasis on issues that have arisen, impacts made, constraints encountered, 
reasons and justifications for any delays on deliverables and suggestions for additional actions 
that might be taken. Quarterly performance reports should not exceed 30 pages. Annexes may be 
included if they support findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the core document. The 
report should contain an executive summary and the following, at a minimum:

Office to obtain access to the DevResults system and ensure proper structure of the system 
as necessary for their activity. 
● 
Any implementation problems as well as proposed corrective actions and the costs 
associated with the delay. 
●

4. 
Environmental Compliance 
1a) The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, Section 117 requires that the impact of 
USAID’s activities on the environment be considered and that USAID include environmental 
sustainability as a central consideration in designing and carrying out its development programs. 
This mandate is codified in Federal Regulations (22 CFR 216) and in USAID’s Automated 
Directives System (ADS) Parts 201.5.10g and 204 (http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/200/), which, 
in part, require that the potential environmental impacts of USAID-financed activities are 
identified prior to a final decision to proceed and that appropriate environmental safeguards are 
adopted for all activities. The Applicant’s environmental compliance obligations under these 
regulations and procedures are specified in the following paragraphs of this NOFO. 


1b) In addition, the recipient must comply with host country environmental regulations unless 
otherwise directed in writing by USAID. In case of conflict between host country and USAID 
regulations, the latter shall govern. 


1c) No activity funded under this Cooperative Agreement will be implemented unless an 
environmental threshold determination, as defined by 22 CFR 216, has been reached for that 
activity, as documented in a Request for Categorical Exclusion (RCE), Initial Environmental 
Examination (IEE), or Environmental Assessment (EA) duly signed by the E&E Bureau 
Environmental Officer (BEO). (Hereinafter, such documents are described as “approved 
Regulation 216 environmental documentation.”) 


2)A Deferral of environmental review ME 22-67 has been approved for this activity funding this 
RFA. USAID/Tunisia will conduct the environmental review for this activity prior to issuing an 
award. Upon conclusion of the TEC and after negotiations with the selected applicant, knowing 
the specifics of the activity design will permit USAID/Tunisia to more accurately identify and 
address any potential environmental risks, and complete the required IEE. An IEE will be 
finalized before an award has been made. 
3a) As part of its initial Work Plan, and all Annual Work Plans thereafter, the Recipient, in 
collaboration with the USAID Agreement Officer’s Technical Representative and Mission 
Environmental Officer or Bureau Environmental Officer, as appropriate, shall review all ongoing 
and planned activities under this Cooperative Agreement to determine if they are within the scope 
of the approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation. 


3b) If the Recipient plans any new activities outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentation, it shall prepare an amendment to the documentation for USAID 
review and approval. No such new activities shall be undertaken prior to receiving written USAID 
approval of environmental documentation amendments. 


3c) Any ongoing activities found to be outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentation shall be halted until an amendment to the documentation is 
submitted and written approval is received from USAID. 



6. 
Climate Risk Mitigation 
All USAID projects and activities approved after October 1, 2016 are required to comply with 
ADS 201mal: Climate Risk Management for USAID Projects and Activities. As per ADS 201, 
USAID should factor climate resilience into international development programs and investments. 
The activity is mainly comprised of capacity building, training, workshops, and site visits to 
locations selected for implementation; therefore, it is ranked as LOW for climate risks, and no 
further action is required.
