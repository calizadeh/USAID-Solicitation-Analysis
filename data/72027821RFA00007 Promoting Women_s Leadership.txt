SECTION A: FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION 


This funding opportunity is authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as 
amended. The resulting award will be subject to 2 CFR 200 – Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and USAID’s

A.1 
OVERVIEW 
The goal of the Promoting the Voice and Leadership of Women Activity is to increase the voice, 
agency1 
and leadership of women in Jordan to increase 
their engagement in decision-making 
within their family, immediate community and at the national level and thus contribute more 
meaningfully to Jordan’s stability, economic prosperity and governance. This will be achieved 
through three mutually reinforcing objectives: 


● 
Strengthened legislative framework enforcement and institutional capacity, 
● 
Increased adoption of inclusive social norms, and 
● 
Enhanced women's skills and opportunities for voice and leadership. 
A.2 
COUNTRY CONTEXT 
The Government of Jordan (GOJ) is facing many economic challenges: reinvigorating its 
economy in an unstable external environment, chronic high unemployment and 
underemployment rates, budget and current account deficits and government debt, an 
unprecedented refugee influx, disrupted trade routes and lower investments and tourism inflows, 
and persistent regional instability and reduced external assistance. To stimulate inclusive 
job-creating growth, boost productivity, and improve household welfare, Jordan must create 
conditions for greater competitiveness and private sector investment. Both national and 
international evidence suggest that focusing on gender equality is not only the right, but also the 
smart thing to do. Jordan has some of the lowest indicators in the world on labor force 
participation, productivity, and gender equality due to chronically low female labor force 
participation rates, which represent a high cost to the Jordanian economy and a missed 
opportunity cost that negatively impacts the gross domestic product and results in a loss of return 
on public spending on education. Simultaneously, the lack of trust and collaborative strategizing 
between government and civil society hinders progress on women’s rights and gender equality. 
Perceived corruption2, limited commitment at the Ministerial 
level, and weak governance also 
hinder women’s ascension into leadership positions in government, further reducing government

A range of research finds correlations between women’s 
participation in government and lower corruption levels, which in turn 
enable greater female participation and leadership.

support and capacity for advancing gender equality. Institutional weaknesses and the eroding 
relevance of some civil society organizations (CSOs) are also resulting in limited capacity for 
impactful advocacy for gender equality.3 
The negative 
socio-related impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on increased household burdens by women and risk of gender-based violence is 
significant and likely to worsen and measures are needed to lessen the impact of the crisis on 
women. At the same time, the crisis also poses some opportunities, such as the adoption of 
flexible work models, that should be capitalized on to prevent reinforcing gendered roles and 
encourage greater gender equality. 


A.3 
LINK TO USAID/JORDAN, USG AND GOJ STRATEGIES AND PRIORITIES 
USAID/Jordan recognizes that when women and girls have equal rights and access to resources 
and services, societies thrive. USAID aims in all of its programming in Jordan to reduce gender 
disparities and empower women and girls to realize their rights, determine their own life goals, 
and help strengthen their communities. This Activity supports the USAID/Jordan 2020-2025 
Country Development and Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) and its Development Objective 5: 
Leadership and Agency of Women and Youth Enhanced.4 
It further advances the principles of 
self-reliance by increasing a country’s capacity and promoting commitment to gender equality 
and women’s empowerment. 


Jordan’s national and sub-national governmental levels took several serious measures and actions 
to advance equality. All three branches of government are proactively seeking affirmative actions 
to advance the rights of women at the national policy, institutional, and operational levels. The 
2020-2025 National Strategy for Women (NSW) in Jordan led by the Jordanian National 
Commission for Women (JNCW) offers a roadmap and the Jordanian State's vision towards 
achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women. It aligns national legislation with 
international and regional commitments while working to expand economic, social, cultural, and 
political support to women. The main goals of the Strategy are: 1) Women and girls are able to 
exercise their rights and freely lead and participate in society; 2) Women and girls enjoy a life 
free of all forms of violence; 3) Positive gender norms, roles, and attitudes support gender 
equality and women empowerment; and 4) Institutions are executing and sustaining policies, 
structures, and services that support gender equality and women’s empowerment. 


A.4 
DEVELOPMENT HYPOTHESIS 
The development hypothesis of the Promoting the Voice and Leadership of Women Activity is: 
by removing barriers to women’s participation and leadership through strengthening legislative 
frameworks, enforcement of those legislations and the enhancement of institutional capacity of 
stakeholders, and by increasing the adoption of inclusive social norms, and stimulating the 
engagement of women in decision-making and leadership roles, the voice and agency of women 
will be enhanced.

This Activity contributes to USAID/Jordan’s CDCS Development Objective 5 by contributing to 
the achievement of Intermediate Result (IR) 5.2: Barriers to Women’s and Youth Participation 
and Leadership Mitigated, sub-IR 5.1.1: Positive Social Practices Promoted, and sub-IR 5.3.4: 
Cross Sectoral Collaboration Improved. The Results Framework and associated indicators for 
Development Objective 5 are included in Annex 2. 


A.5 
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES 
USAID/Jordan seeks transformative change to advance women’s empowerment throughout the 
country. The desired end state of this Activity requires thoughtful national and local level 
interventions to advance the three objectives of this Activity and address the intertwining 
relationships between laws, institutional barriers, and gender norms, power relations, and roles. 
For example, USAID/Jordan recognizes that enabling environment efforts involve both 
addressing national level legislation while concurrently working at the local level to educate, 
train and raise awareness on the enforcement of such legislation. Similarly, with objective 2 
USAID seeks to support creative approaches at the national and local levels to change social 
norms regarding women’s empowerment. Furthermore, it is noted that accomplishment of the 
Activity’s objectives will not be possible without cross-cutting attention to the use of an 
integrated communications strategy, advocacy, capacity building and civil society engagement. 
Finally, it is expected that interventions will address, in a similarly cross-cutting manner, 
marginalized communities, including but not limited to the disability community, female-headed 
households, survivors of gender-based violence, divorcees and juveniles. 


Objective 1 – Legislative Framework Enforcement and Institutional Capacities 
Strengthened 


In Jordan, the main legal and institutional constraint to gender equality is the differential 
definition of men’s and women’s capabilities—the law recognizes men as full legal subjects and 
women as dependents. Thus, women have limited opportunities to realize their potential in 
political representation, family formation, decision-making, mobility, access to resources, job 
opportunities, education, bodily integrity, and a life free of violence. There is a need for legal 
equality in matters such as economic empowerment, political participation, citizenship, 
nationality, guardianship, and rights within marriage and family relationships. And even when 
laws do not prevent women’s access to justice, politics, resources, education, or health, there is a 
lack of effective mechanisms to ensure women’s equal access to opportunities.5 


USAID/Jordan seeks to strengthen the enabling environment for women to fully exercise their 
rights and express their voice without restrictions. Legislation and institutional frameworks play 
a dynamic and overlapping role in forming an environment supportive of gender equality and a 
space to create the necessary change that advances women’s roles in the public and private 
spheres. Recently adopted new laws in Jordan, such as the amended Labor Law addressing wage

descrimination6, the updated Electoral Law and the budget- pending National Action Plan on 
UNSCR 13257 
as well as the revised Law on the Protection 
from Domestic Violence, the Law on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and amendments to the Criminal Code are examples of 
efforts that aim to promote women’s empowerment and tackle gender-based violence (GBV). 
Yet, lack of resources, a dearth of trained personnel, under-representation of women in 
decision-making and leadership posts, and lingering adverse social norms and harmful gender 
stereotypes have proven challenging for implementation, enforcement and overall progress. 
Furthermore, it is noted that there is a disconnect between rights granted to women by the 
Constitution and rights and responsibilities found in various national laws, such as in matters 
related to citizenship and family issues. 


Therefore, USAID, through this Objective, aims to focus on outputs pertaining to effective legal 
frameworks and enforcement mechanisms for gender equality and public institutions having the 
capacity to develop and implement policies, legislations and services, as well as to promote the 
active engagement of women within the community and the public spheres. Effective 
empowerment policies and strategies are required in many areas such as justice, education, 
health, politics, decision-making, family, mobility, and the economy. Without a holistic review 
and revision of all relevant laws and regulatory frameworks that effectively work to abolish all 
types of discrimination and increase women empowement, progress in only some of them and 
lack of coordinated efforts will not overcome stagnation in other domains and is unlikely to 
contribute to women’s overall empowerment and gender equality. USAID seeks to support 
approaches designed to result in a holistic reform of laws and regulations and enforcement of 
these processes and policies that limit inconsistencies or misunderstanding in implementation. 


Under this activity, USAID anticipates that the Recipient will identify opportunities to strengthen 
the capacity of targeted GOJ operating units at both the local or national level for implementing 
and rolling out such proposed legislative changes. Capacity building is expected to take the form 
of traditional interventions--education, training, mentoring--while at the same time employing 
innovative approaches to altering the operating environment and overall receptivity within such 
legal and regulatory authorities. The Activity must ensure that the targeted government 
institutions have the capacity to mainstream gender and equitable practices for increasing 
equality between men and women or decreasing the gap to remove structural barriers and enable 
women to reach their full potential as well as the capacity to support women representation 
bodies. For instance, the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Women’s Empowerment 
(IMC) and the establishment of Gender Units and the attention to gender mainstreaming within 
the government begun under USAID’s prior Takamol and CITIES activities have yielded 
positive beginnings, but much remains to be done,8 
particularly outside of the Gender Units and 
within the overall bodies of the legal and regulatory authorities. 


The Activity should also seek to advance the work of local coalitions of civil society, academia 
and other institutions to advocate for change regarding the rights of women. Furthermore, the 
Activity should work with issue-based civil society, particularly women-led organizations, as

platforms for women to increase their voice on issues of importance and fundamentally advance 
the gender equality agenda through their presence in civic life. 


USAID/Jordan recognizes that data- current, clear and accurate- should inform all decisions at 
the national and local levels. In order to advance women’s empowerment throughout the country, 
a clear understanding of the lived realities of women must be reflected in data. The Recipient 
must ensure that comprehensive data 
on gender 
is available, 
utilizing a “gender approach,” and 
that research centers and think tanks, especially women's studies centers, are strengthened to 
conduct research, data analysis, and data dissemination. 


In implementing this Objective, USAID expects to see concepts such as self-reliance embedded 
fully into the activities as USAID seeks to ensure government and civil society capability are 
sustainable after the life of the proposed activity. Such proposed opportunities should both build 
off of prior work done by USAID and other donors and not seek to “reinvent the wheel”. 


Objective 2 - Adoption of Inclusive Social Norms Increased 


Gender norms are a subset of social norms that relate specifically to gender differences.9 
“Gender 
norms sustain a hierarchy of power and privilege that typically favors what is considered male or 
masculine over that which is female or feminine, reinforcing a systemic inequality that 
undermines the rights of women and girls and restricts opportunity for women and men to 
express their authentic selves.”10 
Like with all social 
norms, it requires sustained effort and time 
to change gender norms. Gender norms are resistant to change because they are pervasive and 
largely invisible, considered ‘normal’, and are held in place by a web of behaviors, beliefs and 
institutions.11 
Under this Objective, USAID/Jordan 
seeks to address prevailing prohibitive social 
norms regarding women and create transformational changes in gender relations at the family, 
community and national levels and in different sectors of the economy, social and political areas. 
The Activity seeks to address social norms related to women’s agency and leadership within the 
family and community, including economic and political participation as well as GBV. All 
norms, as do all cultures, change over time and the intention of this Objective is to help facilitate 
that evolution for gender norms in Jordan. 


To accomplish this Objective, the Recipient will need to develop a communications and 
advocacy strategy to run the life of the program to promote equitable social norms and address 
harmful norms that contribute to challenges faced by women and girls in Jordan and provide the 
appropriate platforms to voice women’s and girls’ needs and concerns. The strategy should also 
address notions of masculinity and the role of men in society and the family that reinforce 
negative gender ideologies, and invite dialogue with men and boys around issues of equality. In 
addition, the communication strategy under this Activity will help promote safe environments 
and raise awareness on GBV issues as a prevention and support mechanism for the work

envisioned under the planned USAID Survivor’s Access to Protection from Domestic Violence 
Activity12 
-- in effect serving as the implementationarm for the social behavior change 
communication and outreach elements of the aforementioned activity. 


The strategy must include a minimum of the following pieces: Tailored local and national 
engagement plans based on the specific needs of each targeted geographic location; media (print, 
television, internet) engagement and outreach13; key governorate engagement and associated 
local level outreach strategies at the community and family level; legislative and advocacy 
planning to complement proposed interventions in Objective 1; and, measurable bench-marks 
with which to track progress against this achieving the goals of the strategy and inform needed 
adaptations throughout implementation. The Recipient should develop and/or utilize existing 
networks and platforms in a manner that allows for mechanisms through which women and men 
and girls and boys can use their voice at the local and at the national level. Since the use of 
specific terminologies also reinforces stereotyping14, 
this strategy should promote the use of 
appropriate language in the public spaces and platforms such as advertisements and media tools 
to raise awareness, and strengthen gender sensitive content and/or code of conduct. 


One way to encourage and replicate the substantive change experienced and demonstrated by 
women is to promote them as role models and influencers in their communities and ensure that at 
all levels of dialogue, interaction, and intervention. Recruitment of male and female role models 
(local/national), champions of change, and influential leaders is a major component under this 
Objective. The Activity should recognize quantifiable and effective representation of female 
leaders who utilize non-traditional norms, but yet are average citizens who can serve as 
successful role models. Additionally, the Activity will utilize individual (male and female) and 
institutional agents of change for the purpose of women’s realization of their rights and voices in 
the political and socio economic spheres. The Activity must dedicate substantial effort and 
resources to ensuring that women and men work as agents of change through community-driven 
approaches not only to improve and promote equality for both women and men, but also provide 
them with real choice about their engagements patterns in work and home while supporting more 
involvement of men in their family lives and caretaking roles. The Activity will also combine a 
focus on women as catalysts for change with working through men and community leaders to 
influence change and promote positive gender roles and women empowerment. 


USAID/Jordan encourages interventions that offer both national and local solutions that are 
reached through full consultation with local leaders and that utilize and build on local efforts, 
tools and platforms. The Activity is expected to address norms consistent with the recently 
released Jordan National Strategy for Women and USAID/Jordan’s CDCS. 


12 
See Annex 4 for the Request for Information for this 
program. 
13 
It is noted that media is an important channel throughwhich new norms are transmitted. Campaigns and advocacy are vital to 
this effort, however, Applicants are encouraged to think through interactive media programs to encourage social dialogue that 
leads to norms change. Research indicates this is important in allowing individuals to own the change.

Objective 3 - Women's Skills and Opportunities forVoice and Leadership Enhanced 


Given the patriarchal, tribal, and nepotistic contexts supporting men’s socioeconomic advantage 
and access to leadership positions and decision-making, women and society stand to benefit from 
clearer pathways to voice, agency and leadership that bypass non-transparent practices of 
appointment and access to knowledge, influential networks, and meaningful inclusive 
decision-making processes. USAID/Jordan recognizes that women are under-represented in 
leadership positions in government, civil society and the private sector and as such USAID seeks 
to support interventions within this Objective to address the need for increased women’s 
leadership skills and opportunities for improved political and private sector engagement among 
women and other marginalized groups as defined under section A.7. 


In order to move the needle on social norms within Jordan, USAID recognizes that women need 
to be mentored and trained to take up leadership and decision-making roles throughout the 
spectrum of society. As such, the Activity seeks to address the need for consistent women’s 
mentorship and leadership training across the spectrum of development assistance. Interventions 
should focus on systemic mechanisms to provide women with resources that enable them to 
meaningfully engage in their communities and realize their full potential. Resources should 
include opportunities for personal development, mentoring, coaching and building leadership and 
management skills for girls and women in early stages of their lives and careers. Moreover, 
USAID seeks to support an approach that includes recruiting mentors and pairing them with their 
peers in non-traditional mentoring programs under specific networking platforms while 
continuing the training of these mentors and providing them with needed soft skills. Efforts 
under this Objective should link to efforts under Objective 1 by encouraging partner government 
organizations to adopt policies, plans, and capacity to improve the meaningful participation of 
women in decision-making processes. 


The Activity should include direct coordination with one or more current (at time of publication 
of this NOFO) USAID/Jordan program(s) to provide and/or supplement one or more of the 
following: leadership and mentorship training for mid-level personnel in GOJ operating units, 
soft skills training, advocacy training, scenario-based interactive training and coalition building. 
This includes potentially working directly with the Women’s Economic Empowerment and 
Leadership Activity which focuses on leadership in the public and private sectors. Additionally, 
the Activity should build on the work of the Takamol and Rule of Law and Public Accountability 
Strengthening activities working with the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) and relevant 
business and sectoral associations to nurture female leaders (training, networking and 
mentorship); create support systems for women and then expose them to the right 
decision-makers. The Activity should also coordinate its efforts with the IPA in order to develop 
mandatory gender training that targets GOJ staff as well as supervisors and senior leadership 
separately based on their needs and general job requirements. 


Interventions under this Objective should also help girls, women and other marginalized groups 
attain the agency to exercise their rights within and outside the private, domestic domain so that 
they are able to make and act upon decisions about their lives and future. This could include 
integrated, cross-sectoral programming that nurtures female leaders such as supporting women in 



elected bodies, including student councils, associations and chambers, and strengthening 
women’s and girls’ skills for more effective communication within the family unit. 


A.6 
CROSS-CUTTING THEMES 
a. 
Coordination and collaboration:The Activity is expectedto build on the achievements and 
lessons learned of previous and ongoing USAID/Jordan15 
programming. Accordingly, 
USAID/Jordan seeks creative approaches to partner and sub-partner coordination around the 
topic of women’s empowerment. This would include a baseline accounting of all women’s 
empowerment work done through Mission programming, identification of key areas of 
complementarity that could lend to potential coalition building (among programs, 
sub-partners or beneficiaries), any areas of divergence from GOJ priorities for women’s 
empowerment, and any training needs at the partner and/or sub-partner level. Such a baseline 
document would then become the first step in a plan to last the life of the program that 
USAID will use to ensure the full integration of women’s empowerment throughout the 
Mission’s programming. 
Interventions under this Activity should also complement the work of other donors, the GOJ, 
civil society, and the private sector. There is a high degree of attention paid to the issue of 
women’s empowerment. As such, the Recipient should utilize approaches that complement 
the existing efforts and seek to strengthen collaboration and coordination mechanisms among 
different stakeholders. In effect, USAID envisions that the Recipient will serve as a 
secretariat to facilitate such coordination on behalf of USAID/Jordan. It should be noted that 
USAID/Jordan will be the face of any/all coordination among and between implementing 
partners and the donor community. 


USAID/Jordan is planning multiple activities that touch on different components of women’s 
empowerment. This Activity must ensure intentional coordination and complementarity to 
those activities to avoid duplication. At a minimum, this Activity must coordinate with the 
Women’s Economic Empowerment and Leadership Activity16, 
the Survivor’s Access to 
Protection from Domestic Violence Activity17, and the 
Public Accountability and Justice 
Strengthening Project18 
. 


b. 
Private Sector Engagement: 
USAID recognizes the value 
of engaging the private sector to 
help shape solutions that achieve sustained impact and can carry forward long after USAID’s 
support has ended. Through its Private Sector Engagement Policy,19 
USAID has issued an 
Agency-wide call to action and mandate to work hand-in-hand with the private sector to 
design and deliver development and humanitarian programs in all sectors. This policy signals 
an intentional shift towards enterprise driven development as a more sustainable way to 
empower people, communities and nations.

USAID Private Sector Engagement Policy. 



The private sector has a significant stake in the success of the GOJ achieving its 
socioeconomic objectives. Private entities of all sizes and sectors see their costs increase and 
efficiency and profitably impaired due to ineffective services at the institutional, procedural, 
and policy levels. Private sector entities of all types play a role in communicating the urgency 
of reform and are critical for identifying problems and finding solutions that improve and 
promote economic inclusiveness and growth. In-line with this, this Activity is expected to 
engage, leverage and/or partner with the private sector, as appropriate, in the identification 
and development of market-based solutions to women’s empowerment, voice and leadership. 
For example, this Activity might work with the private sector to identify and support 
solutions to barriers to female leadership or support outreach and advocacy campaigns for 
regulatory enforcement. 


c. 
Media:While this Activity will not focus on buildingcapacity of the media sector as a 
standalone objective, it will utilize media as a modality for disseminating information and 
messages to promote positive gender norms and build support for legislative reforms and 
enforcement. It will also be used as a role model for gender equality by helping them adopt 
institutional frameworks that curb discrimination against women journalists and instate a 
satisfactory degree of equality with their male co-workers and editing policies for more 
gender-sensitive content and balanced coverage. Finally, it will be used as an accountability 
tool to monitor Jordan’s progress on decreasing the gap between men and women. 
A.7 
TARGET POPULATION AND GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS 
a. 
Underrepresented populations:For the purposes ofthis Activity, the term 
marginalized/underrepresented populations is meant to include, but not be limited to, the 
following subsets of the Jordanian population: the poor, persons with disabilities, religious 
and ethnic minority communities, female heads of household, survivors of gender-based 
violence, individuals at-risk of violence, and juveniles. Interventions under the Activity must 
not discriminate against any segment of the population and must make every effort to comply 
with the objectives of the USAID Disability Policy, the USAID and/or USG policies on 
Gender Equality and Female Empowerment as well as Preventing and Responding to Gender 
Based Violence Globally; and, all other USAID and USG policy documents and directives on 
inclusive development. To that extent, and within the scope of the Activity, the Recipient’s 
actions and approaches must demonstrate a comprehensive and consistent approach for 
including and benefitting men, women, girls and boys from underrepresented segments of the 
population. This may at times mean providing these populations with limited support 
services to help them overcome structural barriers to meaningfully participate in society and 
have greater prospects for a better future. 
b. 
Geographic focus:The Activity should take into considerationthe unique needs of the 
different demographic groups and geographic areas in Jordan, and accordingly undertake 
relevant and responsive interventions. This Activity is inclusive of all persons residing in 
Jordan and can cover the entire country or specific geographic areas as long as the Recipient 

clearly justifies and adequately explains the proposed interventions based on needs and 
reflect the proposed focus in its monitoring plans. 


A.8 
OPERATING PRINCIPLES 
a. 
Aim for transformative change:USAID/Jordan seekstransformative change to advance 
women’s empowerment throughout the country. Transformative change requires holistic, 
coordinated, and mutually reinforcing efforts with all Jordanian stakeholders, including the 
private sector, to challenge the stereotypes restricting women so that they are viewed as 
capable of leading their own lives and fully participating in the decision-making process as 
equals. USAID seeks to design and support approaches beyond individual capacity building 
to strategically integrate institutional and individual transformation initiatives that can help 
move Jordanian communities from persistent gender inequality to enduring gender equality. 
The Recipient will also help USAID develop measures that track transformations in gender 
relations, including the process of achieving desired capabilities. 
b. 
Adopt a systematic, long-term approach: Gender equalityis a complex issue that requires a 
systematic, long-term solution focused on addressing the root causes of constraints that are 
both significant yet amenable to change. The Recipient should adopt a long-term, purposeful 
and intentional approach when designing interventions to achieve the objectives of this 
Activity. Interventions should not be one-off events but rather part of a holistic systematic 
approach with clear milestones that help attain the desired systemic change. Piloting and 
testing is encouraged as long as it feeds into this intentional, systematic long-term approach 
to achieve the desired outcomes. For example, the plan to increase adoption of inclusive 
social norms under Objective 2 should not be one-off campaigns but rather a long-term plan 
under which modalities and messages should be adapted and refined based on learning with 
the desired end goal always in sight. 
c. 
Self-reliance and sustainability: 
Fostering self-reliance 
through sustainability is a key 
component of this Activity to ensure that the suggested solutions are supported and 
maintained by the relevant counterparts once the Activity has ended. USAID seeks to 
advance the ability of a country, working across sectors, including government, civil society, 
citizens, and economic actors, to solve its own development challenges. USAID assistance is 
oriented to support a country’s own transition towards self‐reliance. 
Self-reliance and sustainability will be an integral part of the Activity’s interventions and 
implementation approaches and are expected to start with each of the above-mentioned 
objectives and continue throughout the implementation and beyond. Institutionalized 
practices and processes, building and maintaining partnerships, supporting local partners who 
have not worked with USAID before, utilizing existing resources, exploring new 
opportunities, involving the community, and developing exit strategies for interventions from 
inception are key to guarantee self-reliance through sustainability of this Activity for the long 
term. The Recipient will be expected to reflect such approaches in its work plans, monitoring 
and learning plans, and, to the extent possible, in the Activity’s management structure. 



d. 
Diverse partnership and leveraging local expertise:USAID is committed to fostering more 
flexible, adaptive, and creative approaches to engaging new and potential partners, including 
the private sector, civil society, women’s organizations, youth and disability organizations, 
faith-based organizations, educational institutions, multilateral institutions, and local and 
international organizations.20 
USAID/Jordan recognizes 
that the Activity has the potential to 
incorporate a wide technical range of goals and objectives. In light of this, the Recipient 
should take an inclusive, creative and integrated approach to achieving the goals and 
objectives of this Activity, including partnerships with private-sector entities. 
In doing so and in line with the principle of “nothing about us without us”, the Activity is 
expected to recognize, leverage, and strengthen existing and growing national and local 
expertise and to collaborate with a wide range of actors, especially those new to USAID. All 
interventions should be developed in consultation with local stakeholders to accurately 
reflect the context and challenges. Further, local stakeholders should be empowered to lead 
efforts to the extent possible. 


e. 
CLA and Evidence-based:USAID uses Collaboration,Learning and Adaptation (CLA) to 
achieve better development outcomes. This approach involves strategic collaboration, 
systematic and continuous learning and adaptive management. While CLA is not a new 
approach, these practices often do not occur regularly, are not systematic and not deliberate. 
CLA is not a different work stream or done for its own sake. It is a different way of 
approaching activity design and making implementation as effective as possible to maximize 
development impact. Strong CLA practices vary with organizational culture, project contexts 
and their enabling environment. Partners will achieve this intentionally by identifying 
knowledge gaps in their activity’s theory of change or by filling gaps in the evidence that 
designers used when creating the activity. The intentionality may be achieved by creating and 
taking opportunities for stakeholders to track progress and to discuss challenges, 
opportunities, and changes in context. Implementation will be iterative and adaptive, 
adjusting approaches based on program learning while remaining within the overall scope of 
the resultant award. 
Furthermore, this Activity will learn from and expand upon gender programming by 
strengthening rigorous research and field application, developing and tracking indicators for 
measuring transformational change, improving availability of quantitative and qualitative 
data and analysis of such data, increasing the documentation of implementation successes 
and failures, and disseminating promising practices and applying lessons learned. 


f. 
Do No Harm:Interventions and approaches supportedunder this Activity must advance a 
Do-No-Harm principle ensuring the security and integrity of staff and direct and indirect 
beneficiaries to minimize the harm they may inadvertently be caused through implementation 
of the Activity. Gender equality and inclusive development principles must be well 
incorporated into the Activity’s programming and organizational structures and be modeled 
by its partners and beneficiaries. Achieving the objectives of this Activity involves pursuing 
an inclusive approach by working with women and girls as well as men and boys to bring 
about change at home and in the community to reinforce the value of gender equality and 
20 
USAID 2020 Gender Equality and Female Empowerment 
Policy. 



women’s empowerment and monitor for unintended harmful consequences. Additionally, as 
outlined in the USAID Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Policy, the 
Activity should ensure its beneficiaries have safe access to USAID-funded services and 
activities to reflect USAID’s zero-tolerance stance on the sexual exploitation or abuse of 
beneficiaries.

D.3 
APPLICATION PROCESS 
This 
NOFO 
uses 
a 
phased 
approach 
to 
foster 
collaboration 
and 
co-creation. 
The 
merit 
review 
process 
for 
the 
Promoting 
Women’s 
Voice 
and 
Leadership 
Activity 
will 
consist 
of 
two 
merit 
review 
phases 
followed 
by 
a 
co-creationand 
final 
applicationphase. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
process 
is 
to 
enable 
robust 
discussions 
and 
identify 
an 
applicant 
that 
will 
have 
the 
greatest 
chance 
of 
success 
to 
achieve 
the 
results 
of 
the 
Promoting 
Women’s 
Voice 
and 
Leadership 
Activity. 
THe 
process will consist of the following phases: 


1. 
Phase 
I 
-Concept 
Paper. 
Applicants 
submit 
concept 
papers 
by 
the 
deadline 
stated 
on 
the 
cover 
page 
of 
this 
NOFO, 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
instructions 
set 
forth 
in 
this 
NOFO, 
includinginSectionD.4. 
USAIDwillthenconductameritreviewoftheconceptpapers 
utilizing 
the 
criteria 
set 
forth 
in 
Section 
E.2a). 
After 
completion 
of 
this 
review, 
USAID 
will 
invite 
the 
organization(s) 
whose 
concept(s) 
remain 
under 
consideration 
to 
participate 
in 
Phase 
II 
oral 
presentations. 
Applicants 
not 
advancing 
to 
Phase 
II 
will 
be 
notified 
by 
USAID at the conclusion of Phase I. 
2. 
Phase 
II 
-Oral 
Presentation. 
Applicant(s) 
invited 
by 
USAID 
to 
participate 
in 
Phase 
II 
will 
present 
their 
concept 
papers 
orally 
via 
the 
online 
Google 
Meet 
platform 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
instructions 
set 
forth 
in 
Section 
D.4 
and 
as 
elaborated 
in 
USAID’s 
invitation 
letter. 
USAID 
will 
conduct 
a 
merit 
review 
of 
the 
oral 
presentations 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
criteria 
set 
forth 
in 
Section 
E.2b). 
USAID 
anticipates 
that 
an 
Apparently 
Successful 
Applicant 
will 
be 
determined 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
Phase 
II 
merit 
review. 
Applicants 
not 
selected 
will 
be 
notified 
by 
USAID 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
Phase 
II. 
At 
the 
completion 
of 
this phase, the competition requirements of ADS 303 will be satisfied. 
3. 
Phase III - Co-Creation Workshop. The Apparently SuccessfulApplicant will be invited 
to participate in a one-week co-creation workshop during which the Apparently 
Successful Applicant will co-create and finalize its Program Description jointly with 
USAID/Jordan and other potential stakeholders. The co-creation is an integral part of this 
process to develop the most effective, holistic approach to achieve program objectives. 
USAID expects the co-creation to be a participatory approach with an emphasis on a 
shared vision, responsibility, decision-making and ownership over the ultimate program. 
The workshop will be attended by USAID, the Apparently Successful Applicant and its 
subpartner(s), and potentially other stakeholders. The Apparently Successful Applicant 
should also anticipate commencing budget negotiations during this workshop. Additional 
information regarding the logistics and content of the workshop and program description 
format will be provided as part of the Apparently Successful Applicant invitation letter. 
Depending on the COVID-19 related restrictions at the time, the workshop may be held 
in-person in Amman, be conducted fully online via Google Meet, or be a hybrid of 
in-person and online meetings. 
USAID 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
invite 
more 
than 
one 
Applicant, 
if 
deemed 
appropriate, 
or 
to 
not conduct a co-creation meeting. 



. 


4. 
Phase 
IV 
-Final 
Application. 
Following 
the 
co-creation 
workshop, 
the 
Apparently 
Successful 
Applicant 
will 
have 
approximately 
21 
days 
to 
finalize 
the 
Program 
Description 
and 
accompanying 
cost/business 
application. 
Only 
the 
Apparently 
Successful 
Applicant 
will 
be 
requested 
by 
USAID 
in 
writing 
to 
submit 
a 
Final 
Application. 
No 
other 
applications 
will 
be 
accepted 
or 
reviewed. 
The 
Final 
Application 
will 
expand 
upon 
the 
Concept 
Paper 
and 
Oral 
Presentations 
to 
provide 
more 
details 
about 
the 
planned 
activities 
and 
results 
to 
be 
achieved, 
incorporating 
any 
ideas, 
adjustments, 
feedback, 
etc. 
that 
arose 
during 
co-creation. 
During 
Phase 
IV, 
USAID 
and 
the 
Apparently 
Successful 
Applicant 
may 
communicate 
about 
aspects 
of 
the 
Final 
Application 
in 
order 
to 
finalize 
it. 
When/If 
the 
Final 
Application 
is 
agreed 
upon, 
then 
USAID 
will 
make 
an 
award 
to 
theApparently 
Successful Applicant. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
USAID 
and 
the 
apparently 
successful 
applicant 
are 
not 
able 
to 
reach 
final 
agreement 
on 
the 
award 
or 
terms, 
USAID 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
select 
another 
applicant. 
USAID 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
not 
make 
an 
award 
if 
any 
phase 
of 
the 
process 
is 
not successful. In that event, USAID may elect to issue a new NOFO at its discretion. 


No 
funding 
will 
be 
made 
available 
prior 
to 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Cooperative 
Agreement. 
Applicants 
are 
responsible 
for 
all 
costs 
incurredprior 
to 
the 
award, 
including 
costs 
related 
to the oral presentation and co-creation phases. Pre-Award costs will not be approved. 


Applicants 
not 
selected 
for 
the 
consecutive 
phase 
will 
be 
notified 
at 
the 
end 
of 
each 
phase. 
Unsuccessful applicants may request additional information following such notification. 


It 
is 
the 
applicant’s 
responsibility 
to 
ensure 
that 
all

and received on time. 


D.4 
SUBMISSION PROCEDURES 
a) 
General 
Concept 
Papers 
submitted 
in 
response 
to 
this 
NOFO 
must 
be 
received 
by 
no 
later 
than 
the 
closing 
date 
and 
time 
indicated 
on 
the 
cover 
letter. 
Only 
one 
Concept 
Paper 
per 
prime 
applicant 
organization 
will 
be 
accepted. 
Multiple 
Concept 
Papers 
submitted 
by 
the 
same 
prime 
entity 
will 
not 
be 
considered. 
Late 
applications 
will 
be 
considered 
for 
award 
only 
if 
the 
USAID 
Agreement 
Officer 
(AO) 
determines 
it 
is 
in 
the 
Government’s 
interest. 
Applicants 
must 
retain 
proof 
of 
timely delivery in the form of 
system-generated documentation 
of delivery receipt date and time. 


Applications 
must 
be 
submitted 
by 
email 
to 
jo_promotingwomen@usaid.gov. 
The 
subject 
of 
the 
email 
must 
include 
the 
NOFO 
number 
and 
applicant’s 
name. 
USAID’s 
preference 
is 
that 
the 



technical 
submission 
and 
the 
cost 
application 
each 
be 
submitted 
as 
consolidated 
attachments 
in 
separate 
emails, 
e.g. 
that 
you 
consolidate 
the 
various 
parts 
of 
a 
technical 
submission 
into 
a 
single 
document 
before 
sending 
it 
as 
a 
single 
attachment 
to 
an 
email. 
If 
this 
is 
not 
possible 
and 
documents 
are 
sent 
in 
multiple 
emails, 
the 
subject 
line 
must 
also 
indicate 
the 
desired 
sequence 
of 
the 
emails 
and 
their 
attachments 
(e.g., 
"No. 
1 
of 
4", 
etc.). 
For 
example, 
if 
your 
technical 
application 
is 
being 
sent 
in 
two 
emails, 
the 
first 
email 
should 
have 
a 
subject 
line 
that 
states: 
"[NOFO number], [organization name], Technical Application, Part 1 of 2". 


After 
submitting 
an 
application 
electronically, 
applicants 
should 
immediately 
check 
their 
own 
email 
to 
confirm 
that 
the 
attachments 
were 
indeed 
sent. 
If 
an 
applicant 
discovers 
an 
error 
in 
transmission, 
please 
send 
the 
material 
again 
and 
note 
in 
the 
subject 
line 
of 
the 
email 
that 
it 
is 
a 
"corrected" 
submission. 
Do 
not 
send 
the 
same 
email 
more 
than 
once 
unless 
there 
has 
been 
a 
change, and if so, please note that it is a "corrected" email. 


Applicants 
must 
review, 
understand, 
and 
comply 
with 
all 
aspects 
of 
this 
NOFO. 
Failureto 
do 
so 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
being 
non-responsive 
and 
may 
be 
evaluated 
accordingly. 
Applicants 
should 
retain 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
application 
and 
all 
enclosures 
for 
their 
records. 
All 
applications 
received 
by 
the 
submission 
deadline 
will 
be 
reviewed 
for 
responsiveness 
to 
the 
NOFO 
and 
the 
application format. No additions or modifications will be accepted after the submission date. 


There 
may 
be 
a 
problem 
with 
the 
receipt 
of 
*.zip 
files 
due 
to 
anti-virus 
software. 
Therefore, 
applicants 
are 
discouraged 
from 
sending

Technical Approach (see Section E.2b)1.) 


Each Applicant must present in the oral presentation a detailed explanation of their sound yet 
innovative technical approach to achieving the goals and objectives of each of the components 
set forth in Section A of this NOFO and as outlined in the Applicant’s Concept Paper. In 
describing this technical approach, the Applicant must clearly articulate why the applicant’s 
approach and the proposed interventions conceptually and operationally are feasible and 
sustainable to achieve the USAID’s objectives for the activity, and how the Applicant will 
monitor progress against the proposed approach. 


Management Approach and Staffing Plan (see Section E.2b)2.) 


The Applicant must expound on its Concept Paper to explain, within the context of the technical 
approach, the proposed organizational management, staffing, and capacity to operate efficiently 
and effectively in Jordan. During its presentation, the Applicant should clearly and logically 
describe how it intends to carry out the Promoting Women’s 
Voice and Leadership 
Activity by 
explaining: 


1. 
How the overall management approach reflects all the necessary resources to achieve the 
results of the program description based on the capacity as well as the qualification of the 
team to execute the proposed approach. The applicant must identify all proposed 
subrecipients and/or local partner organizations, and explain their roles, responsibilities and 
technical adequacy, including a discussion of how they will be substantively integrated into 
the implementation of the project. 
2. 
How coordination and collaboration with the Government of Jordan (GoJ), other partners 
and USAID is envisioned to operate. 
3. 
How the applicant will build the capacity of local organizations to transfer knowledge and 
know-how. 
4. 
How the applicant’s staffing plan and mix of staffing skills and knowledge will enable the 
applicant to implement the proposed technical approach effectively. 
Performance History (see Section E.2b)3.) 


The oral presentation will include an overview of the Applicant’s performance history, and that 
of any proposed subawardees. In advance of the oral presentation and as instructed by USAID in 
its invitation letter, the applicant will be expected to provide information regarding its recent 
history of performance 
for all its cost-reimbursement 
contracts, grants, or cooperative 
agreements involving similar or related programs, not to exceed five awards,as follows: 


1. 
Name of the Awarding Organization; 
2. 
Award Number; 
3. 
Activity Title; 

4. 
A brief description of the activity; 
5. 
Period of Performance; 
6. 
Award Amount; 
7. 
Reports and findings from any audits performed in the last 
three years; 
and 
8. 
Name of at least two (2) updated professional contacts who most directly observed 
the work at the organization for which the service was performed with complete 
current contact information including telephone number, and email address for each 
proposed individual. 
If the applicant encountered problems on any of the referenced awards, it may provide a short 
explanation and the corrective action taken. The applicant should not provide general 
information on its performance. USAID reserves the right to obtain relevant information 
concerning an applicant’s history of performance from any sources and may consider such 
information in its review of the applicant’s risk. The Agency may request additional information 
and conduct a pre-award survey if it determines that it is necessary to inform the risk assessment. 


Phase III: Co-Creation Workshop 


Following the Oral Presentations, USAID intends to determine an Apparently Successful 
Applicant and inform the Applicant within approximately 30 days that its application has been 
selected to proceed to the next stage of the process. Competition has been satisfied at this stage. 
The Apparently Successful Applicant Notification Letter will also include information pertaining 
to the logistics and content of the co-creation workshop and program description format. 


In its Notification Letter, USAID will request the Apparently Successful Applicant to submit a 
draft Program Description and Cost/Business Application (see instructions below). USAID will 
provide complete instructions in its letter, and anticipates that the Apparently Successful 
Applicant will have 3 weeks to prepare and submit these documents. The draft documents will 
then be used as the basis for discussion during the co-creation workshop. The Apparently 
Successful Applicant will determine who will be the appropriate persons to attend the workshop 
from its team. At a minimum, the proposed Program Manager must be present for the 
co-creation workshop, and potentially other key personnel candidates as determined by USAID. 
The Apparently Successful Applicant should also anticipate commencing budget negotiations 
during this workshop. 


The Apparently Successful Applicant will be expected to participate in a one-week workshop to 
co-create jointly with USAID/Jordan and other potential stakeholders the Program Description 
for the resulting Cooperative Agreement. This workshop will be attended by the Apparently 
Successful Applicant, USAID, and potentially other stakeholders (e.g., GoJ counterparts; local 
partners). Detailed instructions and information related to logistics will be provided in advance 
of the co-creation workshop. 



Phase IV: Final Application 


Following the Co-Creation Workshop, the Apparently Successful Applicant will refine its 
approach and finalize the Program Description and accompanying cost/business application. The 
final application will be submitted to USAID/Jordan within approximately 21 days of the 
co-creation workshop. USAID will review these and may provide additional clarification 
questions. The Apparently Successful Applicant will have one week to respond and submit its 
final application. Per USAID’s requirements, the final technical and cost/business applications 
will be reviewed for responsiveness to discussions and feedback. If agreement is reached, an 
award will be drafted and submitted to the Apparently Successful Applicant for review. 


If the Apparently Successful Applicant and USAID cannot arrive at a mutually agreeable 
arrangement, USAID may cancel the project at no cost to the Government. USAID/Jordan 
reserves the right to make no award at any stage of the process. 


c) 
Business (Cost) Application Format (see Section E.2c)) 
The applicant(s) must not submit cost application(s) unless/until explicitly requested to do so by 
USAID in writing. Only the Apparently Successful Applicant selected by USAID as a result of 
the Phase II Merit Review will be requested to submit a Cost/Business Application. 


Cost 


The Cost Application must be separate from the Technical Application. While no page limit 
exists for the full cost application, the applicant is encouraged to be as concise as possible while 
still providing the necessary details. The business (cost) application must illustrate the entire 
period of performance, using the budget format shown in the SF-424A. 


Prior to award, applicants may be required to submit additional documentation deemed necessary 
for the Agreement Officer to assess the applicant’s risk in accordance with 2 CFR 200.205. 
Applicants should not submit any additional information with their Phase I and Phase II 
submissions.

The Budget must be submitted as one unprotected Excel file (MS Office 2000 or later versions) 
with visible formulas and references, and must be broken out by project year, including 
itemization of the federal and non-federal (cost share) amount. 
The Applicant must use the 
template that will be provided by USAID with its notification letter to the Apparently Successful 
Applicant. 
Files must not contain any hidden or otherwiseinaccessible cells.Budgets with 
hidden cells lengthen the cost analysis time required to make an award, and may result in a 
rejection of the cost application. 


The Budget Narrative must contain sufficient detail to allow USAID to understand the proposed 
costs. The applicant must ensure the budgeted costs address any additional requirements, such as 
Branding and Marking and environmental compliance. The Budget Narrative must be thorough, 
including sources for cost estimates to support USAID’s determination that the proposed costs 
are fair and reasonable. 


The Budget must include the following worksheets or tabs, and contents, at a minimum: 


● 
Summary Budget, inclusive of all program costs (federal and non-federal), broken out by 
major budget category and by year for activities implemented by the applicant and any 
potential sub-applicants for the entire period of the program. 
● 
Detailed Budget, including a breakdown by year, sufficient to allow the Agency to 
determine that the costs represent a realistic and efficient use of funding to implement the 
applicant’s program and are allowable in accordance with the applicable cost principles, 
for example those found in 2 CFR 200 Subpart E. The Detailed Budget must contain the 
following budget categories and information, at a minimum: 
a. 
Personnel– Must be proposed consistent with 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation Personal 
Services. The applicant’s budget must include position title, salary rate, level 
of effort, and salary escalation factors for each position. The Budget Narrative must 
demonstrate that the proposed compensation is reasonable for the services rendered 
and consistent with what is paid for similar work in other activities of the applicant. 
Applicants must provide their established written policies on personnel compensation. 
If the applicant’s written policies do not address a specific element of compensation 
that is being proposed, the Budget Narrative must describe the rationale used and 
supporting market research. 
b. 
Fringe Benefits – (if applicable) If the applicant has a fringe benefit rate approved by 
an agency of the U.S. Government, the applicant must use this rate and provide 
evidence of its approval. If an applicant does not have a fringe benefit rate approved, 
the applicant must propose a rate and explain how the applicant determined the rate. 

In this case, the Budget Narrative must include a detailed breakdown comprised of all 
items of fringe benefits (e.g., superannuation, gratuity, etc.) and the costs of each, 
expressed in U.S. dollars and as a percentage of salaries. 


c. 
Travel – Provide details to explain the purpose of the trips, the number of trips, the 
origin and destination, the number of individuals traveling, and the duration of the 
trips. Per Diem and associated travel costs must be based on the applicant’s normal 
travel policies. When appropriate please provide supporting documentation as an 
attachment, such as company travel policy, and explain assumptions in the Budget 
Narrative. Allowances, when proposed, must be broken down by specific type and by 
position. 
d. 
Equipment & Supplies 
– Must include information on 
estimated types of equipment, 
models, supplies and the cost per unit and quantity. The Budget Narrative must 
include the purpose of the equipment and supplies and the basis for the estimates. The 
Budget Narrative must support the necessity of any rental costs and reasonableness in 
light of such factors as: rental costs of comparable property, if any; market conditions 
in the area; alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, and value 
of the property leased. 
e. 
Contractual - This category includes the acquisition of items (other than equipment 
and supplies) and/or support services that are ancillary to the program. See 2 CFR 
200.3301 for assistance in determining whether the sub-tier entity is a subaward or 
contractor. 
f. 
Other Direct Costs – This may include other costs not elsewhere specified, such as 
report preparation costs, passports and visas fees, medical exams and inoculations, as 
well as any other miscellaneous costs which directly benefit the program proposed by 
the applicant. Applicants must explain all assumptions in the Budget Narrative. The 
applicant should indicate the subject, venue and duration of any proposed conferences 
and seminars, and their relationship to the objectives of the program, along with 
estimates of costs. 
g. 
Subawards – Specify any subawards to pass-through entities envisioned under the 
prospective cooperative agreement. Subawards are described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(6) 
as “the subawarding, transferring or contracting out of any work under a Federal 
award, including fixed amount subawards as described in §200.333.” Subawards do 
not include the acquisition of supplies, material, equipment or general support 
services. See 2 CFR 200.3301 for assistance in determining whether the sub-tier 
entity is a subaward or contractor. 
In a separate budget tab, the applicant must provide the same level of detail for its 
proposed subawards as is expected for the prime. The subaward budgets must align 
with the same requirements as the applicant’s budget, i.e. the applicant must submit 
detailed budgets for each subawardee, for all federal funding, broken out by budget 
category and by year, for the entire implementation period of the project. 
Subaward 



budgets must also include a Budget Narrative, which provides detailed budget 
explanations and supporting justification of each proposed budget line item. 


h. 
Indirect Costs – Applicants must indicate whether it is proposing indirect costs or will 
charge all costs directly. In order to better understand indirect costs, please see 
Subpart E of 2 CFR 200.414. The applicant must identify which approach it is 
requesting and provide the applicable supporting information. Below are the most 
commonly used Indirect Cost Rate methods: 
Method 1 - Direct Charge Only 


● 
Eligibility: Any applicant 
● 
Initial Application Requirements: See above on direct costs 
Method 2 - Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) 


● 
Eligibility: Any applicant with a NICRA issued by a USG Agency must use that 
NICRA 
● 
Initial Application Requirements: If the applicant has a current NICRA, submit 
your approved NICRA and the associated disclosed practices. If your NICRA was 
issued by an Agency other than USAID, provide the contact information for the 
approving Agency. Additionally, at the Agency’s discretion, a provisional rate 
may be set forth in the award subject to audit and finalization. SeeUSAID’s 
Indirect Cost Rate Guide for Non Profit Organizations 
for further guidance. 
Method 3 - De minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) 


● 
Eligibility: Any applicant that has never received a NICRA 
● 
Initial Application Requirements: Costs must be consistently charged as either 
indirect or direct costs, but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged 
as both. If chosen, this methodology once elected must be used consistently for all 
Federal awards until such time as a non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate an 
indirect rate, which the non-Federal entity may apply to do at any time. The 
applicant must describe which cost elements it charges indirectly vs. directly. See 
2 CFR 200.414(f) for further information. 
If the applicant does not have an approved NICRA and does not elect to utilize the 
10% de minimis rate, the Agreement Officer will provide further instructions and may 
request additional supporting information, including financial statements and audits, 
should the application still be under consideration after the merit review. USAID is 
under no obligation to approve the applicant’s requested method. 


i. 
Cost Sharing – This NOFO does not require a cost share. 
5) PriorApprovals in accordance with 2 CFR 200.407 
Inclusion of a cost item in the detailed application budget does not satisfy any requirements for 
prior approval by the Agency. If the applicant would like the award to reflect approval of any 
cost elements for which prior written approval is specifically required for allowability, the 



applicant must specify and justify that cost. See 2 CFR 200.407 for information regarding which 
cost elements require prior written approval. 


6) Approval of Subawards 
The applicant must submit information for all subawards that it wishes to have approved at the 
time of award. For each proposed subaward the applicant must provide the following: 


● 
Name of organization; 
● 
DUNS Number; 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient does not appear on the Treasury Department’s Office 
of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list; 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient does not have active exclusions in the System for 
Award Management (SAM); 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient is not listed in the United Nations Security 
Designation list; 
● 
Confirmation that the subrecipient is not suspended or debarred; 
● 
Confirmation that the applicant has completed a risk assessment of the subrecipient, in 
accordance with 2 CFR 200.331(b); 
● 
Any negative findings as a result of the risk assessment and the applicant’s plan for 
mitigation. 
7) Dun and Bradstreet and SAM Requirements 
USAID 
may not 
award to an applicant unless the applicant 
has complied with all applicable 
unique entity identifier (DUNS number) and System for Award Management (SAM) 
requirements. Unless the applicant is an individual or Federal awarding agency that is exempted 
from requirements under 2 CFR 25.110(b) or (c), or has an exception approved by the Federal 
awarding agency under 2 CFR 25.110(d), each applicant is required to: 


a. 
Provide a valid DUNS number for the applicant and all proposed subrecipients; 
b. 
Be registered in SAM 
before 
submitting its application. 
SAM is streamlining its 
processes, eliminating the need to enter the same data multiple times, and consolidating 
hosting to make the process of doing business with the government more efficient 
(www.sam.gov). 
c. 
Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times 
during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration 
by a Federal awarding agency. 
The registration process may take many weeks to complete.Therefore, applicants are encouraged 
to begin the process early. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements above by 
the time USAID is ready to make an award, USAID may determine that the applicant is not 
qualified to receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to 
another applicant. 


DUNS number: 
http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform 



SAM registration: 
http://www.sam.gov 


Non-U.S. applicants can find additional resources for registering in SAM, including a Quick 
Start Guide and a video on how to obtain an NCAGE code, on 
www.sam.gov, navigate to Help, 
then to International Registrants. 


7. Funding Restrictions 
Profit is not allowable for recipients or subrecipients under this award. See 2 CFR 200.330 for 
assistance in determining whether a sub-tier entity is a subrecipient or contractor. 


Construction 
will not be authorized under this award. 


USAID will not allow the reimbursement of pre-award costs under this award without the 
explicit written approval of the Agreement Officer. 


Except as may be specifically approved in advance by the AO, all commodities and services that 
will be reimbursed by USAID under this award must be from the authorized geographic code 
specified in Section B.4 of this NOFO, and must meet the source and nationality requirements 
set forth in 22 CFR 228. 


D.5 
POTENTIAL REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION 
Upon consideration of award or during the negotiations leading to an award, applicants may be 
required to submit additional documentation deemed necessary for the Agreement Officer to 
make an affirmative determination of responsibility. 
Applicants should not submit the 
information below with their applications. 
The information 
in this section is provided so that 
applicants may become familiar with additional documentation that may be requested by the 
Agreement Officer. 


If requested, the information should substantiate: 


(1) 
Bylaws, constitution, and articles of incorporation, if applicable. 
(2) 
Whether the organizational travel, procurement, financial management, accounting manual 
and personnel policies and procedures, especially regarding salary, promotion, leave, 
differentials, etc., submitted under this section have been reviewed and approved by any 
agency of the Federal Government, and if so, provide the name, address, and phone number 
of the cognizant reviewing official. The applicant should provide copies of the same. 
When requested, the Apparent Successful Applicant shall provide copies of the requested 
additional documents. 



D.6 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST PRE-AWARD TERM (AUGUST 2018) 
a. Personal Conflict of Interest 
1. 
An actual or appearance of a conflict of interest exists when an applicant 
organization or an employee of the organization has a relationship with an 
Agency official involved in the competitive award decision-making process that 
could affect that Agency official’s impartiality. The term “conflict of interest” 
includes situations in which financial or other personal considerations may 
compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, the obligations and duties 
of a USAID employee or recipient employee. 
2. 
The applicant must provide conflict of interest disclosures when it submits an 
SF-424. Should the applicant discover a previously undisclosed conflict of 
interest after submitting the application, the applicant must disclose the conflict of 
interest to the AO no later than ten (10) calendar days following discovery. 
b. Organizational Conflict of Interest 
The applicant must notify USAID of any actual or potential conflict of interest that they 
are aware of that may provide the applicant with an unfair competitive advantage in 
competing for this financial assistance award. Examples of an unfair competitive 
advantage include, but are not limited to, situations in which an applicant or the 
applicant’s employee gained access to non-public information regarding a federal 
assistance funding opportunity, or an applicant or applicant’s employee was substantially 
involved in the preparation of a federal assistance funding opportunity. USAID will 
promptly take appropriate action upon receiving any such notification from the applicant.

b) 
Phase II - Oral Presentation Merit Review 
(See 
Section D.4b), Phase II)) 
The 
oral 
presentations 
will 
be 
evaluated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
following 
merit 
criteria 
in 
descending 
order of importance: 


1. Technical Approach 
2. Management Approach and Staffing 
3. Performance History 
1. 
Factor 1: 
Technical Approach 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
applicant 
clearly 
and 
convincingly 
demonstrates 
how 
its 
approach 
is 
technically-sound, 
feasible 
and 
sustainable 
in 
achieving 
or 
surpassing 
the 
activity objectives. 


2. 
Factor 2: 
Management Approach and Staffing 
The quality, clarity and responsiveness of the applicant’s overall management approach, 
including the proposed management structure, local partnerships (if any), staffing plan 
and proposed key personnel, in demonstrating the necessary expertise, technical and 
administrative capability, and relevant experience to successfully implement the proposed 
Program Description. In addition, the extent of engagement of the key personnel in 
presenting the applicant’s technical, management and staffing approach and responding to 
clarifications, if any, during the oral presentation phase. 


3. 
Factor 3: 
Performance History 
Applicants will be evaluated on how well the Applicant and its proposed sub-partners 
have performed on past projects of relevant scope, magnitude and scale. This will 



include reviewing instances of excellent, good, and/or poor performance, significant 
achievements and problems in the most critical areas. 


USAID may use performance information obtained from sources other than those 
identified by the Applicant. USAID will utilize existing databases of agreements 
performance information if any and solicit additional information from the references 
provided in and from other sources if and when the Agreement Officer finds the existing 
databases to be insufficient for evaluating an applicant’s performance. 


c) 
Cost Application Review Criteria (see Section D.4c)) 
USAID/Jordan will evaluate the cost application to determine whether the costs are allowable in 
accordance with the applicable cost principles.. The cost application will be evaluated but will 
not be assigned a rating. 


USAID/Jordan will also consider (1) the extent of the applicant's understanding of the financial 
aspects of the program and the applicant's ability to perform the activities within the amount 
requested; (2) whether the applicant's plans will achieve the program objectives with reasonable 
economy and efficiency; and (3) whether any special conditions relating to costs should be 
included in the award. 


The AO will perform a risk assessment (2 CFR 200.205). The AO may determine that a 
pre-award survey is required to inform the risk assessment in determining whether the 
prospective recipient has the necessary organizational, experience, accounting and operational 
controls, financial resources, and technical skills – or ability to obtain them – in order to achieve 
the objectives of the program and comply with the terms and conditions of the award. Depending 
on the result of the risk assessment, the AO will decide to execute the award, not execute the 
award, or award with “specific conditions” (2 CFR 200.207). 


[END OF SECTION E] 



SECTION F: FEDERALAWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION 


F.1 
FEDERALAWARD NOTICES 
Award of the agreement contemplated by this NOFO cannot be made until funds have been 
appropriated, allocated and committed through internal USAID procedures. While USAID 
anticipates that these procedures will be successfully completed, potential applicants are hereby 
notified of these requirements and conditions for the award. The Agreement Officer is the only 
individual who may legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds. No costs 
chargeable to the proposed Agreement may be incurred before receipt of either a fully executed 
Agreement or a specific, written authorization from the Agreement Officer. 


Following selection for award and successful negotiations with the apparently successful 
applicant, an electronic copy of the notice of the award signed by the Agreement Officer will 
be sent to the successful applicant, which serves as the authorizing document. The Agreement 
Officer will only do so after making a positive responsibility determination that the applicant 
possesses, or has the ability to obtain, the necessary management competence in planning and 
carrying out assistance programs and that it will practice mutually agreed upon methods of 
accountability for funds and other assets provided by USAID. 


The 
award 
will 
be 
issued 
to 
the 
contact 
as 
specified 
in 
the 
application 
as 
the 
Authorized 
Individual in accordance with the requirements in the Representations and Certifications. 


USAID 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
perform 
a 
pre-award 
survey, 
which 
may 
include, 
but 
is 
not 
limited 
to,: 
(1) 
interviews 
with 
individuals 
to 
establish 
their 
ability 
to 
perform 
agreement 
duties 
under 
the 
project 
conditions; 
(2) 
a 
review 
of 
the 
prime 
recipient’s 
financial 
condition, 
business and personnel procedures, etc.; and, (3) site visits to the prime recipient’s institution. 


F.2 
ADMINISTRATIVE & NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS 
The resulting award from this NOFO will be made under relevant federal regulations and agency 
policy. 


For U.S nongovernmental organizations, awards must be administered according to 2 CFR 200 
and 2 CFR 700, and USAID Standard Provisions will apply 
(https://www.usaid.gov/ads/policy/300/303maa). 


For non-US non-governmental organizations, USAID provisions for non-U.S. non-government 
organizations will apply (https://www.usaid.gov/ads/policy/300/303mab). 


The actual Standard Provisions included in the award will be dependent on the organization that 
is selected. The award will include the latest Mandatory Provisions for either U.S. or non-U.S. 
Nongovernmental organizations. The award will also contain the “required as applicable” 



Standard Provisions. The full text of all mandatory and required as applicable standard 
provisions will be included in the award document. 


F.3 
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
The Recipient will adhere to all reporting requirements listed below; further, US 
Nongovernmental organizations need to be in compliance with 2 CFR 200 and 2 CFR 700 
(specifically 2 CFR 200.327-329). The Recipient will submit all reports by the due date for 
approval from the Agreement Officer’s Representative (AOR). The Recipient will consult with 
the AOR on the format and content prior to submission. In addition to the reports below, the 
AOR may request additional information to contribute to the internal USAID project reviews. 


(a) Program Reporting 
The Recipient must submit a copy of each report required by this Agreement to the Agreement 
Officer, the AOR, and the Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC). Submission to the 
DEC must be through the public-facing and searchable DEC Website (http://dec.usaid.gov ). 


(1) 
Annual Implementation Plan 
The implementation plans for all USAID/Jordan activities are aligned with the USG Fiscal Year 
Calendar (October 1 to September 30). The Recipient will submit its first implementation plan to 
the AOR for approval 
within 45 calendar days 
of Award. 
The first implementation plan will 
cover the period from the start date of the Award until the end of the first USG fiscal year of the 
Activity – therefore the first implementation plan may cover less than twelve months depending 
on the date of Award. The AOR will provide comments within 20 calendar days to the Recipient 
and the Recipient will have 15 calendar days to respond and make all requested changes, after 
which the AOR will provide final approval within 15 calendar days. 


All 
subsequent 
implementation 
plans 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
AOR 
no 
later 
than 
October 
1 
and 
will 
cover 
an 
entire 
Fiscal 
Year, 
i.e. 
October 
1 
to 
September 
30. 
The 
AOR 
will 
provide 
comments 
within 
20 
calendar 
days 
to 
the 
Recipient 
and 
theRecipient 
will 
have 
15 
calendar 
days 
to 
respond 
and 
make 
all 
requested 
changes, 
after 
which 
the 
AOR 
will 
provide 
final 
approval 
within 
15 
calendar 
days. 
All 
implementation 
plans 
must 
be 
developed 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
AOR, 
other 
USAID/Jordan 
activities, 
donor 
programs, 
relevant 
local 
stakeholders, 
beneficiary 
communities, and all other relevant stakeholders as designated by the AOR. 


The award will be guided by the Program Description which will provide an overall project 
‘map’ that indicates broad activities, expected outcomes, annual milestones, and budget along 
the five year timeline. Annual implementation plans will include planned activities for the given 
USG fiscal year year, time-frame, implementation of activities, an itemized and detailed budget, 
review of the previous year’s accomplishments (if applicable), problems and challenges 
encountered in achieving specified results, proposed annual outputs, and progress towards 
achieving results. The implementation plans must also describe a plan and timeline for internal 



monitoring and evaluation that takes into account the PMP and the external monitoring and 
evaluation plan. 


The first year’s implementation plan must also include a gender and social inclusion analysis, 
and integrate interventions to address the findings from the analysis. Subsequent annual 
implementation plans should then reflect any updates to the analysis and planned interventions. 
The gender and social inclusion analysis should contain information related to as many of the 
five domains listed under 
ADS 205.3.2. 
as possible. 
The proposed interventions, integrated in the 
implementation plan, should directly address the gaps identified in the gender and social 
inclusion analysis. The activity's logic model and proposed indicators should reflect the 
gender-sensitive issues that the activity will impact. 


The Recipient must ensure that the implementation plan integrates a sustainability approach for 
after USAID-funded efforts end. The sustainability approach must address key sustainability 
challenges for key partners. It must detail a roadmap for how the Recipient will work with key 
partners during the program to address these key challenges. 


Annual 
implementation 
plans 
must 
not 
deviate 
from 
award 
requirements. 
All 
activities 
planned 
through 
this 
process 
must 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
award 
Program 
Description 
and 
consistent 
with 
the 
approved 
budget 
for 
the 
award. 
Inclusion 
of 
items 
in 
the 
implementation 
plans 
does 
not 
obviate 
the 
need 
to 
seek 
specific 
approvals 
from 
USAID 
when 
those 
additionalapprovals 
might 
be 
required 
by 
policy 
and 
regulation. 
Modifications 
to 
the 
annual 
implementation 
plan 
that 
respond 
to 
changed 
conditions 
may 
be 
proposed 
by 
the 
Recipient 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
AOR; 
however, 
in 
no 
case 
may 
any 
implementation 
planactivity 
deviate 
fromthe 
Program 
Description 
or award terms. 


(2) 
Activity Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL) 
Plan 
As 
per 
ADS 
201, 
the 
Recipient 
is 
required 
to 
submit 
for 
AOR 
approval 
an 
Activity 
Monitoring, 
Evaluation 
& 
Learning 
(MEL) 
Plan 
for 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Activity 
based 
on 
its 
proposed 
monitoring, 
evaluation 
and 
Learning 
(MEL) 
strategy 
for 
collecting, 
evaluating 
and 
validatingdata 
which 
will 
be 
used 
to 
measure 
overall 
progress 
towards 
Mission 
goals. 
The 
draft 
Activity 
MEL 
Plan 
is 
due 
to 
the 
AOR 
within 
90 
calendar 
days 
of 
the 
award, 
with 
afinal 
version 
due 
to 
theAOR 
within 
120 
calendar 
days 
of 
the 
award. 
All 
aspects 
of 
the 
MEL 
Plan 
should 
be 
in 
line 
with 
USAID’s 
ADS 
201 on assessing and learning and adhere to the following: 


● 
Activities 
must 
have 
an 
approved 
Activity 
MEL 
Plan 
in 
place 
before 
major 
implementation 
actions 
begin. 
The 
AOR 
will 
work 
with 
the 
Recipient 
and 
the 
Mission’s 
M&E 
Specialist(s) 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Activity 
MEL 
Plan 
is 
consistent 
with, 
and 
meets 
the 
data 
collection 
needs 
of 
the 
Mission’s 
Performance 
Management 
Plan 
(PMP), 
and 
the 
Mission’s annual Performance Plan and Report (PPR). 
● 
Within 
60 
calendar 
days 
of 
agreement 
award 
and 
prior 
to 
submitting 
the 
Activity 
MEL 
Plan, 
the 
Recipient 
should 
submit 
a 
theory 
of 
change 
describing 
the 
causal 
and 
logical 
relationships 
between 
different 
levels 
of 
results, 
along 
with 
the 
associated 
interventions, 
indicators 
and 
other 
performance 
data, 
and 
critical 
assumptions 
under 
each 
result. 
The 
work 
plan 
should 
also 
reflect 
this 
causal 
and 
logical 
relationship 
between 
results 
and 
the 

performance measures to track progress. 


● 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
should 
include 
a 
narrative 
that 
clearly 
articulates 
the 
activity’s 
theory 
of 
change, 
describing 
the 
causaland 
logical 
relationships 
between 
different 
levels 
of 
results, 
along 
with 
the 
associated 
interventions, 
indicators 
and 
other 
performance 
data, 
and 
critical 
assumptions 
under 
each 
result. 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
should 
also 
present 
a 
logic 
model 
that 
illustrates 
these 
results, 
the 
causal 
and 
logical 
relationships 
between 
them, 
and 
the 
indicator and other performance data required to measure each. 
● 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
should 
include 
approaches 
for 
a 
systematic, 
intentional 
and 
resourced 
approach 
to 
a 
strategic 
collaboration, 
continuous 
learning 
and 
adaptive 
management. 
In 
developing 
the 
MEL 
Plan, 
the 
Recipientshould 
identify 
and 
describe: 
learning 
objectives 
with 
corresponding 
information 
needs; 
strategic 
opportunities 
to 
“pause 
and 
reflect” 
and 
coordinate 
and 
collaborate 
with 
stakeholders; 
approaches 
for 
regular 
learning 
to 
address 
the 
identified 
learning 
objectives; 
plans 
for 
documenting 
the 
knowledge 
and 
learning 
from 
these 
opportunities, 
and 
disseminating 
findings; 
resources 
(financial 
and 
human 
resources 
as 
well 
as 
tools) 
needed 
to 
implement 
learning 
approaches; 
and, 
approaches 
to 
adapting/adjusting implementation and programming as a result of this learning. 
● 
The 
Recipient 
will 
develop 
performance 
indicators 
and 
establish 
baselines 
and 
targets 
for 
output, 
outcome, 
and 
impact 
level 
monitoring, 
as 
well 
as 
benchmarks 
for 
performance 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
activity. 
The 
baselines 
and 
targets 
will 
be 
developed 
with 
oversight 
from 
and 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
Mission’s 
Program 
Office 
and 
MEL 
recipient. 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
should 
also 
contain 
metrics 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
successful 
interventions 
introduced 
with 
activity 
support. 
The 
AOR 
will 
provide 
a 
list 
of 
Mission 
PMP 
indicators 
required 
for 
the 
activity. 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
must 
include 
the 
required 
Mission 
PMP 
indicators 
along 
with 
any 
others 
being 
proposed 
by 
the 
Recipient 
that 
are 
deemed 
necessary 
or 
useful 
in 
measuring 
progress 
against 
the 
overall 
goal 
and 
project 
objective(s). 
Selected 
indicators 
should 
be 
a 
combination 
of 
performance 
and 
context 
indicators. 
Recipients 
should 
be 
strategic 
in 
their 
selection 
of 
additional 
indicators 
to 
ensure 
an 
appropriate 
balance 
between 
required 
data 
and 
the 
resource 
costs 
of 
data 
collection, analysis and reporting. 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
must 
include 
quarterly 
and/or 
annual 
targets, 
as 
per 
the 
indicator 
requirements, 
necessary 
to 
reach 
the 
life 
of 
project 
targets 
identified 
by 
the 
Mission 
for 
required 
Mission 
indicators 
and 
identified 
by 
the 
Recipient 
for 
all 
other 
indicators. 
USAID 
criteria 
for 
selecting 
performance 
indicators 
is 
that 
they 
be 
direct, 
objective, 
practical, 
adequate, 
management 
useful 
and 
reflect 
progress 
toward 
achieving 
results, 
and, 
to 
the 
extent 
possible, 
be 
attributable 
to 
USAID. 
Performance 
data 
must 
meet 
reasonable 
quality 
criteria 
of 
validity, 
reliability, 
timeliness, 
precision 
and 
integrity. 
The 
Recipient 
and 
USAID 
will 
agree 
upon 
the 
final 
choice 
of 
performance 
indicators 
useful 
for 
timely 
management 
decisions 
and 
credibly 
reflecting 
the 
actual 
performance 
of 
the 
activity. 
● 
USAID/Jordan 
may 
require 
the 
Recipient 
to 
track 
and 
report 
on 
additional 
performance 
indicators 
subject 
to 
changing 
of 
Agency 
guidance 
and/or 
the 
requirements 
of 
specific 
funding sources and the Mission’s own Performance Management Plan (PMP). 
● 
The 
Recipient 
must 
collect,analyze, 
and 
submit 
to 
USAID 
data 
disaggregated 
by 
sex 
and 
geographic 
location 
as 
applicable. 
To 
ensure 
that 
USAID 
assistance 
makes 
the 
maximum 
optimal 
contribution 
to 
gender 
equality, 
performance 
management 
systems 
and 
evaluations 
must 
include 
gender-sensitive 
indicators 
and 
sex-disaggregated 
data 
when 

applicable 
and 
feasible; 
M&E 
plans 
should 
also 
capture 
proposed 
actions 
that 
will 
address 
any 
identified 
gender-related 
issues. 
Geographic 
disaggregation 
is 
required 
to 
the 
first 
administrative 
level 
at 
a 
minimum; 
in 
Jordan 
this 
corresponds 
to 
the 
governorate 
level. 
The 
Recipient 
should 
also 
consider 
including 
other 
relevant 
disaggregations 
for 
indicators – for example, age and type of institution. 


● 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
must 
also 
include, 
in 
consultation 
with 
USAID, 
agreed-upon 
planned 
internal 
and 
external 
evaluations 
and 
evaluation 
questions 
that 
are 
salient 
to 
the 
implementation, 
adaptation 
or 
review 
of 
the 
activity 
in 
line 
with 
the 
USAID 
Evaluation 
Policy. 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
should 
demonstrate 
how 
the 
timing 
and 
content 
of 
evaluations 
and 
questions 
will: 
help 
clarify 
and 
focus 
activity 
objectives; 
serve 
as 
an 
early 
warning 
system, 
forecasting, 
and 
reporting 
tool; 
promote 
on-going 
discussions 
pertaining 
to 
activity scope and direction; and, aid in effective management and decision making. 
● 
The 
MEL 
Plan 
must 
also 
include 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
monitoring 
approach 
and 
estimated 
resources 
required 
to 
successfully 
implement 
the 
MEL 
Plan. 
This 
will 
be 
done 
through 
describing 
the 
Recipient’s 
M&E 
system, 
including 
policies 
and 
procedures 
for 
how 
data 
and 
information 
will 
be 
collected, 
analyzed, 
and 
used; 
methodology 
of 
establishing 
baselines 
and 
targets; 
staffing/expertise, 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
for 
the 
management 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
MEL 
Plan; 
systems 
(automated 
or 
other) 
where 
data 
will 
be 
collected 
and 
stored; 
resources 
for 
M&E 
functions; 
procedures 
for 
communicating 
with 
USAID; 
means 
of 
adapting 
and 
learning; 
schedule 
for 
M&E 
functions, 
such 
as 
reporting 
performance 
data, 
assessing 
progress 
and 
making 
adjustments if needed; etc. 
● 
Reporting 
on 
performance 
indicators 
will 
be 
done 
through 
the 
Mission’s 
performance

2 
CFR 
200.307 
for U.S. NGOs or the standard provision entitled Program Income for non-U.S. NGOs. 


F.5 
TEAMS AND USAID-SPONSORED J-1 VISAS 
All 
host 
country 
nationals 
being 
funded 
fully, 
partially, 
directly, 
or 
indirectly 
by 
USAID 
must 
enter 
the 
U.S. 
on 
a 
J-1 
Visa, 
regardless 
of 
the 
type 
or 
duration 
of 
the 
activity. 
In 
order 
to 
secure 
a 
J-1 
visa, 
each 
participant 
must 
first 
secure 
a 
DS-2019 
form 
(Certificate 
of 
Eligibility 
for 
Exchange 
Visitor 
J-1 
Status). 
The 
Training 
& 
Exchanges 
Automated 
Management 
System 
(TEAMS) is the only means of obtaining a DS-2019 for USAID- funded Exchange Visitors. 


USAID/Jordan 
delegates 
the 
TEAMS 
data 
entry, 
verification, 
and 
reporting 
responsibilities 
for 
exchange 
programs 
held 
in 
the 
United 
States 
to 
the 
Recipient 
(the 
R1 
and 
R2 
roles). 
USAID/Jordan’s 
Program 
Office 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
approval 
(the 
R3 
role) 
of 
all 
U.S.-based 
training 
programs 
and 
participants 
that 
are 
funded 
by 
USAID. 
USAID/Jordan’s 
AORs 
are 
responsible 
for 
working 
with 
the 
Recipient 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
data 
is 
entered 
and 
approved 
appropriately 
and 
in 
a 
timely 
fashion 
in 
TEAMS. 
USAID/Washington 
is 
responsible 
for 
submission of the data (the R4 role) to SEVIS. 


The 
Recipient 
must 
initiate 
the 
process 
for 
obtaining 
the 
requisite 
DS-2019 
for 
their 
participant 
trainees 
and 
exchange 
visitors 
at 
least 
45 
calendar 
days 
before 
the 
start 
of 
the 
U.S.-based 
training 
or 
exchange 
program. 
The 
Recipient 
is 
responsible 
for 
delivering 
the 
DS-2019 
form 
to 
the 
participant 
so 
that 
he/she 
can 
present 
it 
to 
the 
Consular 
Officer 
during 
their 
appointment 
for 
a 
J-1 
visa 
at 
the 
U.S. 
Embassy 
consular 
section, 
or 
designated 
Consulate. 
The 
Recipient 
is 
also 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that 
the 
participants 
completestheir 
program 
successfully 
and 
returns 
to 
their 
home 
country. 
If 
the 
training 
or 
exchange 
program 
is 
cancelled 
after 
the 
issuance 
of 
the 
DS-2019 
form(s), 
the 
Recipient 
is 
responsible 
for 
returning 
the 
unused 
DS-2019 
forms 
to 
USAID’s Program Office. 


The 
Recipient 
is 
expected 
to 
liaise 
with 
the 
Program 
Office, 
through 
their 
AOR, 
for 
further 
guidance, 
clarifications 
and 
applicable 
templates. 
This 
includes 
the 
process 
for 
rolling 
out 
TEAMS 
for 
their 
activity, 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
for 
managing 
data 
in 
the 
system, 
and 
issuance of USAID sponsored J-1 visas. 


F.6 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
COMPLIANCE 
The 
Foreign 
Assistance 
Act 
of 
1961, 
as 
amended, 
Section 
117, 
requires 
that 
the 
impact 
of 
USAID’s 
activities 
on 
the 
environment 
be 
considered 
and 
that 
USAID 
include 
environmental 
sustainability 
as 
a 
central 
consideration 
in 
designing 
and 
carrying 
out 
its 
development 



programs. 
This 
mandate 
is 
codified 
in 
Federal 
Regulations 
(22 
CFR 
216) 
and 
in 
USAID’s 
ADS 
204, 
which 
require 
that 
any 
potential 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
USAID-financed 
activities 
be 
identified 
prior 
to 
a 
final 
decision 
to 
proceed 
and 
that 
appropriate 
environmental 
safeguards 
are 
adopted 
for 
all 
activities. 
The 
Recipient’s 
environmental 
compliance 
obligations 
under 
these 
regulations and procedures are specified in the following paragraphs of this NOFO. 


In 
addition, 
the 
recipient 
must 
comply 
with 
host 
country 
environmental 
regulations 
unless 
otherwise 
directed 
in 
writing 
by 
USAID. 
In 
case 
of 
conflict 
between 
host 
country 
and 
USAID 
regulations, the latter shall govern. 


No 
activity 
funded 
under 
this 
Cooperative 
Agreement 
will 
be 
implemented 
unless 
an 
environmental 
threshold 
determination, 
as 
defined 
by 
22 
CFR 
216, 
has 
been 
reached 
for 
that 
activity, 
as 
documented 
in 
a 
Request 
for 
Categorical 
Exclusion 
(RCE), 
Initial 
Environmental 
Examination 
(IEE), 
or 
Environmental 
Assessment 
(EA) 
duly 
signed 
by 
the 
Bureau 
Environmental 
Officer 
(BEO). 
(Hereinafter, 
such 
documents 
are 
described 
as 
“approved 
Regulation 216 environmental documentation.”) 


An 
Initial 
Environmental 
Examination 
(IEE) 
(ME 
19-24) 
has 
been 
approved 
for 
a 
wider 
Project 
funding 
including 
this 
Award. 
USAID 
has 
determined 
that 
the 
Award 
qualifies 
for 
a 
Categorical 
Exclusion, 
this 
indicates 
that 
proposed 
interventions 
do 
not 
have 
an 
effect 
on 
the 
natural or physical environment. 


As 
part 
of 
its 
initial 
Annual 
Implementation 
Plan, 
and 
all 
Annual 
Implementation 
Plans 
thereafter, 
the 
Recipient, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
AOR 
and 
Mission 
Environmental 
Officer 
or 
Bureau 
Environmental 
Officer, 
as 
appropriate, 
shall 
review 
all 
ongoing 
and 
planned 
activities 
under 
this 
Award 
to 
determine 
if 
they 
are 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
approved 
Regulation 
216 
environmental documentation. 


If 
the 
Recipient 
plans 
any 
new 
activities 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
approved 
Regulation 
216 
environmental 
documentation, 
it 
shall 
prepare 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
documentation 
for 
USAID 
review 
and 
approval. 
No 
such 
new 
activities 
shall 
be 
undertaken 
prior 
to 
receiving 
written 
USAID approval of environmental documentation amendments. 


Any 
ongoing 
activities 
found 
to 
be 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
approved 
Regulation 
216 
environmental 
documentation 
shall 
be 
halted 
until 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
documentation 
is 
submitted and written approval is received from USAID. 


F.7 
CLIMATE 
RISK MITIGATION 
All 
USAID 
projects 
and 
activities 
approved 
after 
October 
1, 
2016 
are 
required 
to 
comply 
with 
ADS 
201mal: 
Climate 
Risk 
Management 
for 
USAID 
Projects 
and 
Activities. 
As 
per 
ADS 
201, 
USAID 
should 
factor 
climate 
resilience 
into 
international 
development 
programs 
and 
investments. 
It 
is 
envisioned 
that 
the 
activity 
will 
mainly 
be 
comprised 
of 
capacity 
building, 
training, 
workshops, 
and 
site 
visits 
to 
locations 
selected 
for 
implementation; 
therefore, 
it 
is 
ranked as LOW for climate risks, and no further action is required. 



F.8 
BRANDING STRATEGY & MARKING PLAN 
It is a federal statutory and regulatory requirement (see Section 641, Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended and 2 CFR 700.16) that all USAID programs, projects, activities, public 
communications, and commodities that USAID partially or fully funds under a USAID grant or 
cooperative agreement or other assistance award or sub-award must be marked appropriately 
overseas with the USAID identity. In accordance with ADS 320.3.3 Branding and Marking 
Requirements for Assistance Awards USAID’s policy is that programs, projects, activities, 
public communications, or commodities implemented or delivered under co-funded instruments 


– such as grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards that usually require a cost 
share generally are “co-branded and co-marked.” 
The Apparently Successful Applicant will be required to submit a Branding Strategy and 
Marking Plan to be reviewed and approved by the Agreement Officer prior to award execution. 
A Branding Strategy and Marking Plan must be in accordance with USAID Branding and 
Marking Plan as required per ADS 320 at the following link: 
https://www.usaid.gov/ads/policy/300/320. See 2 CFR 
700.16 or, for non-U.S. organizations, see 
the provision entitled “Marking and Public Communications Under USAID-Funded Assistance”. 


The Recipient must comply with the requirements of the USAID “Graphic Standards Manual” 
available at 
www.usaid.gov/branding, or any successor 
branding policy. 


The Agreement Officer will review the proposed Branding Strategy and Marking Plan for 
adequacy to ensure that it complies with the Agency branding and marking guidance that can be 
found at 
http://www.usaid.gov/branding/ 
and at 
http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/300/320.pdf. 
Applicants need to include anticipated costs for branding strategy and marking plan in the 
budget and describe these costs in detail to the degree possible in the budget narrative. The 
Agreement Officer will ensure that any estimated costs associated with branding and marking 
are included in the Total Estimated Amount of the grant or cooperative agreement or other 
assistance award.
