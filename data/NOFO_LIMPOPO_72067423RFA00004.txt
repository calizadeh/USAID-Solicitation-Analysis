SECTION A: PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 

 

Achieving and Sustaining HIV/TB Epidemic Control in the Limpopo Province 

SUMMARY 

South Africa is an upper-middle income country, with many cultures, languages, ethnic groups, and 
religions. In 2021, the population was estimated at 59.6 million, of which approximately 51% (30 
million) were female.1 South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world, with an estimated 
nearly 8 million people living with HIV (PLHIV),2 accounting for 21% of PLHIV globally.3 Adult 
(15-49) HIV prevalence is 18.9%; among women aged 15-49, it is 25.0%.4 While incidence is 
declining each year, the HIV burden in South Africa continues to grow. Nationally, there are 
approximately 198,311 new HIV infections estimated to occur between mid-2021 to mid-2022 with 
women over 15 accounting for 62.7% of all new HIV infections.5

In Limpopo Province, tuberculosis and HIV are the fourth and seventh leading causes of death, 
respectively. Approximately 9% of PLHIV in South Africa live in Limpopo Province; of those people 
living with HIV, 91% know their status, of those who know their status, only 68% are on antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) and of those on ART, 89% are virally suppressed (91-68-89) performance against the 
UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets). These figures mirror national trends (refer to “A: South Africa National 
Current Statistics and Epidemiology”) that indicate initiation and retention on HIV treatment remain 
the biggest barriers to controlling the HIV epidemic by 2030, as per the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal 3, Good Health and Well Being. It is worth noting that Limpopo Province has the 
second lowest percentage of (to Western Cape Province) known PLHIV on ART. HIV/TB co-
infection prevalence varies across districts within Limpopo Province and overall is lower than the 
national prevalence. In 2018, co-infection prevalence was 132 per 100,000 people in the province 
compared to the national prevalence of 217 per 100,000. 

The goal of USAID’s “Achieving and Sustaining HIV/TB Epidemic Control in the Limpopo Province” 
(hereinafter referred to as the Activity) is to support long, healthy lives for the population of Limpopo 
Province by achieving and sustaining HIV/TB epidemic control. USAID aims to reach this goal by 
achieving the following strategic objectives: (1) Close the gaps to HIV epidemic control; (2) Sustain 
health gains through strengthened, improved, and resilient health systems; and (3) Leverage 
community, civil society, traditional structures, and private sector partnerships to improve and sustain 
service delivery and client outcomes. The geographic focus is two districts in the Limpopo Province: 


Capricorn and Mopani Districts. USAID may change the geographic coverage based on 
epidemiological data and/or Government of South Africa (GoSA) and U.S. Government (USG) 
priorities. The estimated period of performance is five years, and the total estimated amount to be 
awarded is approximately US $80 million. 

USAID strongly encourages effective, evidence-based approaches (with new “innovation”6 where 
appropriate to the context) that are tailored specifically to address the development challenges of 
attaining HIV epidemic control and TB elimination in the Limpopo Province. Effective and working 
partnerships with communities, community-based organizations, private sector, and civil society that 
will result in services reaching the people most in need is encouraged. Identifying and resolving health 
systems barriers will be key to promoting long-term sustainability of results achieved under the 
Activity. 

6 Innovation refers to the development and implementation of a new intervention, process, policy, product, or approach that increases 
quality, impact, efficiency and/or results.

A. BACKGROUND 

 

1. Limpopo Provincial Context 


 

Limpopo is considered a rural province with a population of 5.9 million.7 The population is young: 
33% are under age 15, and 51% are under age 25.8 Out-migration driven by individuals seeking 
employment in Gauteng Province has led to an overall decline in the province’s population over the 
last five years.9 

 

Mining and agriculture are the primary drivers of the economy in Limpopo; however, many remain 
unemployed. The official unemployment rate was 32.5% in the third quarter of 2021; while the 
expanded rate - which includes discouraged work seekers who have given up looking for work - 
reached 54.5%10 Adult poverty is the highest in the country at an estimated 67.5% prior to the SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic.11 Access to electricity and piped water remain uneven throughout the province. 
One-quarter of residents report no access to piped water on- or off-site, and nearly 40% rely on water 
vendors for reliable access.12 

 

The vast majority of individuals in Limpopo depend on the public sector for health care. Less than one 
in ten reported having private medical aid in 2020,13 and health and development needs are 


widespread. The 2021 Limpopo State of Health Report, a product of PLHIV/community-led 

 

Health services in Limpopo must be tailored to the context of the population, which includes 
strengthening health systems and services for the large proportion of youth in the province and for 
populations of sometimes migratory miners and agricultural workers. The provincial Department of 
Health identifies a number of interconnected issues as the intermediate and distal determinants of 
health in the Province: lack of employment opportunities, poor housing, inadequate water and 
sanitation, food insecurity, high levels of alcohol and substance abuse, low levels of social cohesion, 
violence (including gender-based violence) and inadequate health-systems.14 Deepening inequalities 
due to out-migration and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have the potential to further exacerbate these 
problems.

2. Government of Limpopo’s Response 


 

The Limpopo provincial structure mirrors that of the national GoSA and implements national policies, 
frameworks and strategic plans to achieve HIV epidemic control and TB elimination. The National 
Departments of Health (NDoH), Basic Education (DBE), and Social Development (DSD) lead the 
response as outlined in the South African National Strategic Plan for HIV, TB and STIs 2017-2022 
(the NSP).15 The NSP guides the HIV and TB response in the province aiming to strengthen service 
quality and innovation. The Limpopo DoH develops and implements Annual Performance Plans 
(APP) in line with the NSP for optimal HIV, TB and STI service delivery. The Limpopo Provincial 
Department of Health indicates in its five-year planning documents that its highest aim is “a long, 
healthy life for all residents of the province.” The priorities outlined in the 2020/21 Limpopo DoH 
APP include improved HIV/ TB health outcomes; improved quality of health services (e.g. reduced 
waiting times and improved staff attitudes); pandemic preparedness; improved leadership, governance 
and policy (e.g. functional Clinic Committees and Ideal Clinic status); reduced staff vacancies and 
skilled human resources; medicines and equipment availability; improved health management 
information systems and data use for evidence-based decision making; improved financial 
management and sustainability; and strategic partnerships, including the private sector.16 

 


3. United States Government’s (USG) Response 


 

Through the PEPFAR Initiative, USAID, in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 
and the U.S. Peace Corps supports South Africa in reaching the 95-95-95 UNAIDS targets. 
USAID/Southern Africa’s (hereinafter referred to as USAID) Regional Development Cooperation 
Strategy (RDCS) for 2020-2025 provides an overview of the USG’s commitment to bolstering 
development in the Southern African region and advancing integrated solutions for locally led, long-
term prosperity. USAID public health investments emphasize programmatic linkages between 
prevention and treatment at both the community and facility level, while promoting simplified service 
delivery models and a locally led and managed HIV response. In 2014, PEPFAR launched the 
DREAMS Initiative – “Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe: 
Preventing HIV in Adolescent Girls and Young Women” – to aggressively target PEPFAR resources 
to reduce new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Since 2004, 
USAID has supported Limpopo to decrease HIV incidence by 52%, reducing new HIV infections 
from 48,520 in 2004 to 25,006 in 2022. Through the GlobalVax initiative, USAID also supported the 
national and provincial departments of health to administer more than 4.2 million COVID-19 
vaccinations in the Limpopo Province while strengthening district health teams to respond to the 
global pandemic. 

B. ACTIVITY GOAL, OBJECTIVES, RESULTS & EXPECTED OUTCOMES 

 

1. GOAL 


 

The goal of this Activity is to support long, healthy lives for the population of the Limpopo Province 
by achieving and sustaining HIV epidemic control. 

 

This Activity will partner with the Limpopo DoH and targeted districts to support the successful 
execution of the Limpopo Province Annual Performance Plan 2021/22 and future provincial health 
strategies.17 The Limpopo DoH actively encourages the direct engagement of traditional health 
practitioners, ward-based outreach teams and private sector organizations in their response to 
improving equitable access to HIV/TB services. Investing in and building the capacity of South Africa 
local organizations (private and non-profit) will foster locally led and locally developed innovative 
approaches towards achieving Limpopo DoH’s objectives of building a stronger health system, 
universal health coverage, improved clients’ experience of care, and reduced morbidity and mortality.

This Activity will implement responsive interventions to reach HIV-affected populations tailored to 


NOFO Nr.: 72067423RFA00004

their unique needsand barriers to health services. The Activity will promote acontinuum of care forPLHIV, leveraging community platforms, including PLHIV networks, faith-based institutions, andsocial support services. In collaboration and support of Provincial andDistrict Health Departments,
the Activity will tailor systems strengthening interventions to the needsand context of the Limpopo 
Province, addressing themajor impediments to achieve HIV epidemic control for all populations. TheActivity will strengthen continuous quality improvement and quality assurance in line with 
Department of Health initiatives, which may include interventions and ways of working, such as theGoSA Ideal Clinic (Operation Phakisa in Limpopo Province) program, which uses health policies, 
protocols and guidelines, and harnesses stakeholders to improve the patient experience and health 
outcomes.18Additionally, this Activity will support the GoSA Nerve Center Approach, and the use ofdata to drive the quality improvement cycleatProvince, District and facility levels.Finally, thisactivity will support community-led monitoring (CLM) programs such asRitshidze, a South African 
community-led monitoring system developed by PLHIV-led organizations that systematically collectsand reports patient reported data to identify challenges to and generate solutions for quality servicedelivery.19

2.OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS
The Activity will consist of three (3) objectives which areas follows: 

Objective 1:Close the gaps to HIV epidemic control through tailored approachesObjective 2:Sustain health gains through strengthened, improved, and resilient health systemsObjective 3:Leverage community, civil society, and private sector partnerships to improve and 
sustain service delivery and client outcomes

(Please see the funding information with the funding breakdown by objective in Section Dof the 
NOFO.)

The following describesin detail the three objectives and related intermediate results to be achievedover the life of this Activity. Indicators and targets are proposed for thefirst yearand may be subjectto review and changes throughout each subsequent year based on the evolving epidemiology of theHIV epidemic in the Limpopo Province and priorities of the Limpopo DOH. 

OBJECTIVE 1:Close the gaps to HIV epidemic control through tailored approaches

Complex barriers to access quality health care, client psychosocial barriers, and treatment hesitancylead to failed treatment initiations and treatment interruptions. This is especially challenging in theLimpopo Province where the population is severely impacted by poverty, unemployment, migration,

and other social issues. 

 

In addition to the socio-economic issues described above, the health facilities in Limpopo often face 
severe overcrowding due to space constraints. Many health facilities do not have access to soap and 
running water and don’t have enough staff to manage the patient population. This causes long waiting 
times and overwhelmed staff which hinder patients' desire to adhere to clinic appointments. The 
Activity will support health facilities to adopt integrated, simplified, client-centered HIV/TB 
prevention and treatment models that facilitate lifelong healthy outcomes for all PLHIV and prevent 
onward HIV and TB infections. 

 

The level and type of assistance will evolve over the life of the Activity as geographic target areas 
attain epidemic control. Annually, specific interventions in support of achieving Objective 1 will be 
determined in collaboration with the Limpopo Provincial and District Departments of Health and 
USAID. 

 

Objective 1 has three intermediate results (IRs) as detailed below. 

 

IR 1.1 Improved pediatric treatment outcomes through tailored approaches 

 

Expected Outcomes 

● 95% of children know their HIV and TB status 
● 95% of children and adolescents living with HIV are on antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
● 95% of children and adolescents living with HIV are virally suppressed 
● 100% of children and adolescents living with HIV receive social support services 


 

While Limpopo has made significant progress initiating adults on treatment, progress amongst 
pediatric and adolescent populations remains slow.20 Pediatric HIV management is challenging due to 
the complexity of disclosure, consent, testing and case management among pediatric populations. 
These challenges are further pronounced by the migratory pattern in the province resulting in children 
living with foster parents or relatives while their biological parents seek other economic activities in 
the country. Successfully identifying children and adolescents living with HIV (C/ALHIV), initiating 
and retaining them on ART, requires a multi-pronged approach. The IR will facilitate a pediatric 
continuum of care between health facilities, communities, and households to achieve positive 
treatment outcomes for C/ALHIV. 

20 Thembisa 4.5 2022 model outputs as described in: Johnson LF, May MT, Dorrington RE, Cornell M, Boulle A, Egger M and Davies 
MA. (2017) Estimating the impact of antiretroviral treatment on adult mortality trends in South Africa: a mathematical modeling study. 
PLoS Medicine. 14(12): e1002468DHIS (January 2022), TIER.Net (September 2020), Naomi Model (September 2020), ART DHIS 
Cohort VLD VLS rates 12 months (April to June 2020) 

 


The Activity aims to improve pediatric treatment outcomes by targeting integrated and tailored 
interventions and technical support that will result in identifying undiagnosed C/ALHIV, effectively 
linking and retaining diagnosed children in care, ensuring routine access to viral load testing, and 
ultimately achieving viral suppression among this target population. The Activity aims to support 
integrated implementation of critical interventions aligned to the national Pediatrics and Adolescent 
Matrix of Interventions. The Activity aims to support treatment optimization through the country’s 
transition to pediatric Dolutegravir (pDTG) to accelerate viral suppression and improve outcomes. In 
alignment with the national prevention of mother to child transmissions (PMTCT) guidelines, the 
Activity aims to support universal testing and treatment for HIV infected pregnant and breastfeeding 
women to attain viral suppression and reduce vertical transmission towards the goal of elimination of 
mother-to-child-transmission. 

 

The Activity will also promote family-focused solutions that support disclosure, treatment literacy 
and other facilitators to improve clinical outcomes and the overall health and wellbeing among 
C/ALHIV and their caregivers. The Activity will facilitate case management and bi-directional 
referral models between health facilities and social support services, including Orphans and 
Vulnerable Children implementing partners and Limpopo Department of Social Development, to 
strengthen the continuum of care for children, youth and their families. This includes leveraging other 
USG resources such as PEPFAR-supported DREAMS partners and clinical care and treatment 
partners. 

 

IR 1.2 Improved adult clinical outcomes for HIV and TB through sustainable and indigenously led, 
social support services and client centered approaches 

 

Expected Outcomes 

● 95% of adult PLHIV diagnosed and know their HIV status 
● 95% of PLHIV sustained on ART, including those co-infected with HIV/TB 
● 95% of PLHIV on ART achieve viral suppression 
● 100% of eligible clients initiated and completed TB preventive treatment 


 

Treatment adherence and retention for PLHIV is critical to attain viral load suppression and reduced 
incidence of HIV disease. Treatment interruption remains a barrier to viral suppression and healthy 
outcomes in Limpopo for all PLHIV across age and sex categories. The Activity will strengthen 
clinical services and promote interventions to remove barriers to superior treatment regimens, mitigate 
treatment interruption adapted to individual clients' needs, and expand options for PLHIV to receive 
treatment and other support services that facilitate ART retention. 

 

The Activity will promote effective and evidence-based interventions that facilitate simplified services 
such as telemedicine, multi-month dispensing, community-based ART and differentiated models of 


care. The Activity will promote tailored and integrated interventions (including innovation where 
appropriate to the context), including private health providers, for clients new to treatment and others 
who are clinically unstable (e.g., unsuppressed viral load, uncontrolled non-communicable diseases, 
mental health disease). These may include enhanced counseling, mental health services, psychosocial 
support, and PLHIV peer led case management, in line with local and international best practices. 

 

Program data demonstrate that in Limpopo Province, groups known to have challenges with treatment 
adherence, include young men, children, youth, and key populations. These challenges include stigma, 
discrimination, access, and insufficient treatment literacy. Furthermore, expanding access to HIV 
treatment to key populations is critical to reaching epidemic control. Creating an enabling 
environment, with zero tolerance for stigma and discrimination, for key populations in public health 
facilities is critical for improving care and treatment outcomes. As such, the Activity will work with 
provincial and district Departments of Health, USAID funded partners and other stakeholders to 
expand key population competent and friendly services in the public health sector. 

 

While HIV epidemic control is reached when the total number of new HIV infections falls below the 
total number of deaths from all causes among PLHIV, the ultimate goal is to achieve population-based 
viral suppression among HIV-infected clients and to prevent further transmission of the virus. To 
achieve this, PLHIV and clinicians need to monitor viral load and suppression, currently defined as 
less than 50cp/ml by South Africa NDoH guidelines. This requires intensified targeting of services for 
those who are not yet virally suppressed and/or at risk of disengagement in care, including clients who 
present with advanced HIV disease during treatment or at initiation of treatment. 

 

Finally, South Africa faces the dual epidemics of TB and HIV and is among the eight countries that 
account for two-thirds of the global TB cases. Tackling HIV/ TB co-infection and attaining 85% TPT 
completion rate in the Limpopo Province will require multi-pronged strategies that will address socio-
economic, structural, programmatic, and patient related treatment adherence challenges. To address 
these challenges, technical support may include a comprehensive package of HIV and TB integrated 
services and interventions expanded to include community-based care, such as TB screening for all 
PLHIV and C/ALHIV, optimized HIV and TB care and treatment and TB prevention. 

 

IR 1.3 Strengthened HIV prevention services for priority populations, with a specific focus on 
children, adolescents, youth, men and key populations at-risk 

 

Expected Outcomes to be achieved: 

● 100% of supported sites provide friendly services for priority populations 
● 100% of supported sites provide PrEP services integrated into existing service delivery points 
● 100% of supported sites provide a minimum package of clinical services to clients who 
experienced sexual and gender-based violence 



● 100% of supported sites link at-risk adolescents and youth to prevention services 


 

As each district works towards achieving and sustaining treatment saturation, HIV prevention, 
stigma and discrimination reduction and gender based violence (GBV) case identification 
remains critically important and needs to be scaled and optimized, more especially for children, 
adolescents, youth, men and key populations at-risk where the rate of new infections remains 
substantial.21 These groups are often the most vulnerable to acquiring HIV, are disproportionately 
affected by high rates of intimate partner violence and sexual violence, and face the greatest barriers 
to accessing services needed to protect themselves. Locally developed, evidence-based, person-
centered prevention interventions and risk-reduction messages must be developed and implemented 
in partnership with other PEPFAR-funded prevention and OVC partners in supported districts, 
including facilities, schools, churches, and community-based organizations. The Activity aims to 
contribute to HIV epidemic control through the prevention of new HIV infections and reduction of 
stigma and discrimination for those who are HIV positive by strengthening the integration of HIV and 
violence prevention and clinical post-violence response services across key HIV service delivery 
points including psychosocial support, HIV testing, Sexual and Reproductive Health Services and HIV 
care and treatment.

OBJECTIVE 2: Sustain health gains through strengthened, improved and resilient health 
systems 

 

As South Africa progresses toward HIV epidemic control and elimination of TB, the management of 
HIV, as a chronic condition, and TB, as a curable infectious disease, will require a health system that 
is resilient; well-financed and managed; and where the necessary, efficiently resourced (e.g., human 
resources, equipment, commodities). Access to care must be equitable and affordable, and the 
necessary systems for planning for such access must be functioning. 

 

Objective 2 aims to support the achievement of HIV epidemic control, the elimination of TB, and 
control of other infectious diseases by strengthening the public health system to public and private 
sector systems, partnerships and cross-sector coordination that will maintain and sustain this status 
over time and will be resilient in the face of system-wide shocks, such as pandemics, natural disasters 
and social unrest. COVID-19 has taught us about the importance of health system resilience and the 
need to support districts to mitigate the impact of such shocks on the health system and patient care. 
Specific areas of focus under Objective 2 that are recognized as some of the most significant 
development challenges related to health systems strengthening include human resources for health 
(HRH), essential medicines and commodities, health information systems, data use for decision 
making and implementation of policies and guidelines related to HIV epidemic control. This Activity 


aims to leverage partnerships with a range of private sector actors with the capacity to contribute to 
addressing factors affecting the health system. Under Objective 2, there are four (4) IRs as detailed 
below. 

 

IR 2.1 Adequate, skilled, and motivated HRH in all targeted health facilities to maintain and sustain 
the delivery of healthcare services to HIV/TB clients 

 

Expected Outcomes to be achieved: 

● HRH Strategy, including a Joint Annual Staffing Plan, developed and approved in line with 
GoSA policy guidelines and approved by Provincial Leadership, in place by the end of Year 2 
and revised annually in Years 3,4 and 5 
● Annual vacancy rate reduced in line with the provincial APP target 
● Annual attrition rate reduced in line with the provincial APP target 
● Annual Training Plan developed, approved, and implemented in line with the APP and 
Regional Training Center 
● Functional, capacitated, and accountable Ward-based Outreach Teams (including Community 
Health Workers) for improved health outcomes 


 

Limpopo Province has suffered from high vacancy and attrition rates across the province due to myriad 
factors. Additionally, the Province has experienced challenges with implementing effective Ward-
based Outreach Teams as outlined in the GoSA Primary Health Care Re-engineered model.22 To 
achieve and sustain HIV epidemic control in the Limpopo Province and supported districts, there must 
be sufficient technical and human capacity to manage, maintain and deliver the HIV and TB services, 
systems and resources.23 This requires a robust HRH Strategy, including staffing needs, staffing 
norms, capacity development and performance management. 

22 The Primary Healthcare Re-engineering of the healthcare system is a mechanism for improving health systems effectiveness and 
achieving universal coverage for preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitation, and palliative healthcare services. The primary health 
care re-engineering approach consists of three streams namely: 1) District-based clinical specialist teams with an initial focus on 
improving maternal and child health; 2) Ward-based outreach teams for each geographical ward; and 3) Integrated school health teams 
that provide screening, education, and preventive services at schools. 

23 https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/COP22-Guidance-Final_508-Compliant-3.pdf 

 

The Activity aims to support the Limpopo DoH and Districts to ensure that there is adequate skilled 
staff to sustain the delivery of HIV and TB related health care services, including health facility 
management. To achieve a sustained HIV epidemic, the health workforce needs to remain updated 
with skills as new evidence, approaches, clinical guidelines, and standard operating procedures 
become available. The regional training centers are critical to ensure that the existing health workforce 
has access to their continued education for improved quality health service delivery. The Activity aims 
to develop and capacitate the reach, effectiveness, and accountability of ward-based outreach teams 
for the achievement of person-centered care across the continuum of HIV prevention, case finding and 


treatment. The achievement of the Activity will require close collaboration with the province and 

 

IR 2.2: Essential medicine and commodities, equipment, instruments, and devices needed to deliver 
quality HIV/TB health and other infectious disease services are available at targeted health care 
facilities 

 

Expected Outcomes to be achieved: 

● Improved medicine availability at Health Establishments in line with provincial targets 
● Essential equipment, instruments and devices are available at all supported sites and as 
assessed through National Core Standards and Ideal Clinic 
● Improved data quality and reporting compliance on the National Surveillance Center (NSC) 
to improve visibility and decision support 


 

Limpopo Province is seeking optimized visibility and accountability for medicine, commodities, 
equipment and instruments supply, distribution, and monitoring. Additionally, an efficient and 
responsive supply chain is the backbone of any effective national public health program. For a program 
to run effectively, the right commodities have to be made available at the right place and at the right 
time. This requires institutionalized demand forecast accuracy, optimization of the replenishment 
planning processes and key supply chain management best practices to ensure that essential medicines 
are available at health establishments. In addition to medicine and commodities, the focus of the 
Activity is to support the districts to assess the availability of basic equipment, instruments, devices 
and technologies, and develop plans and leverage partnerships (as described in IR 3.2 below) to 
address any gaps at all supported sites. Essential equipment, instruments and devices required for 
routine HIV and TB care and treatment are a priority for the Limpopo DoH. 

 

IR 2.3 Utilization and management of existing health information systems and data to guide 
decision making and client management is strengthened 

 

Expected Outcomes to be achieved: 

● 100% of data staff effectively use and implement data systems, data tools and processes 
● 100% of facilities reporting quality data successfully into DHIS and TIER.Net 
● 100% of district, sub-district and facility management routinely use data to improve patient 
outcomes 


 

As per the Limpopo DoH Annual Performance Plan (APP), it is a key priority to implement a robust, 
effective and integrated health management information system to improve evidence-based decision 
making. The Activity aims to assist the supported districts to develop and implement a feasible plan 


to strengthen, institutionalize and integrate systems and processes, improve data quality, data 
management and reporting activities and drive data use for decision making. 

 

Programmatic reviews using the latest available data is essential for decision making, adaptive 
management and continuous quality improvement of the HIV and TB Program. Interventions should 
improve data demand and facilitate effective program review and data use forums (e.g., nerve centers) 
at district, sub-district and facility levels for continuous program improvement and improved client 
outcomes. Finally, effective records management is necessary for overall HIV and TB program and 
client management and requires improved and institutionalized filing systems and file flow at all 
supported sites to reduce client waiting times and file loss. 

 

IR2.4 Effective governance and management systems at the province, district, and facility levels 
(management, planning, budgeting and monitoring systems) are in place 

 

Expected Outcomes to be achieved: 

● Timely adoption of national health policies and guidelines at the province, district and 
supported sites 
● Annual and Quarterly Joint Strategic and Work Plans Developed (e.g., APP, DHP, Annual 
DSP Work Plan) 
● Quarterly Joint Program Reviews conducted (including local government, PEPFAR, 
Provincial and District AIDS Councils) 
● Health governance structures at the provincial, district and site levels are inclusive, 
transparent, accountable, and responsive to all stakeholders 


 

Effective leadership, governance and management systems are necessary for effective health service 
delivery. This allows for a culture of accountability and a strategic framework to guide the work to be 
done. The aim of the Activity is to support the strengthening of skills of district health management 
teams to be effective managers and leaders with a focus on effective program management. 

 

This Activity aims to work with district health management teams to mobilize all role players (from 
all partners, including locally led community-based organizations, provincial and district AIDS 
Councils) to coordinate, collaborate and use resources effectively for the achievement of program 
results, including joint annual and quarterly planning and review meetings. As outlined in South 
Africa’s NSP and the National Health Insurance (NHI) White Paper, it is critical to address the social 
determinants of health that drive the HIV epidemic.24 This can only be achieved through coordinated 
resource mobilization and dialogue between sectors such as health, social development, civil society 
organizations, faith based organizations, the private sector, and non-government organizations. The 

24 Vera Scotti Nikki Schaayi Helen Schneideri,ii David Sanders,iii. Addressing social determinants of health in South Africa: the journey continues. 
South African Health Review. 2017 – 20 Year Anniversary Edition. 


aim of the Activity is to support the districts with capacitating AIDS Councils, and to support Limpopo 
DoH and districts with the collaboration and coordination between provincial and local AIDS 
Councils, ensuring comprehensive participation and engagement across sectors. 


Additionally, this Activity aims to ensure community engagement in the governance of facility service 
delivery, ensuring responsible use of resources at the health facility level, responsiveness of the 
management of health facilities to community needs, and quality service delivery. Technical support 
may include the capacitation of clinic committees to provide an avenue to give input and feedback 
into the planning, delivery and organization of health services and play an oversight role in the 
governance and provision of equitable health services. 

 

Finally, South Africa is swift to adopt and adapt most global health recommendations and policies for 
the South African HIV/TB context. This translates to robust and comprehensive national policies, 
guidelines and standard operating procedures. Once national policies are approved, they are then 
cascaded to provinces, then districts, sub-districts and health facilities. Often these policies and 
procedures are disseminated to provinces but are not adapted for each province and disseminated 
further for training and implementation by the healthcare workforce. It is essential to assist the 
supported districts to ensure policies, procedures and memos from NDoH are implemented at all 
levels. 

 

OBJECTIVE 3: Leverage community, civil society, and private sector partnerships to improve 
service delivery and client outcomes. 

 

Locally led development and delivery of HIV/TB services through resilient district health systems, 
local partners, civil society organizations (CSOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), faith-
based organizations (FBOs) and the private sector will be the cornerstone of sustainability for HIV 
epidemic control. USAID is committed to increasing capacity and fostering success by catalyzing 
innovation and mobilizing cross-sector partnerships.25 Ending the HIV and TB epidemics requires 
government, community, civil society, and private sector engagement. 

25 A partnership may be defined as an arrangement where parties (entities), agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. The partnerships 
may be contract-based, sub-awardee based or defined by a Memorandum of Understanding. The partners may include formal and informal 
community-based organizations, PLHIV-led organizations, faith-based organizations, schools, governments, private sector, or a combination thereof. 
Organizations may partner to increase the likelihood of achieving expected results. 

 

Objective 3 aims to support indigenously led innovation, leadership, and implementation by 
leveraging community (including Traditional Health Practitioners), civil society, and private sector 
partnerships to improve service delivery and client outcomes and to address the social determinants of 
health that support client retention in care. Under Objective 3, there are two (2) IRs as detailed below. 

 


IR3.1 PLHIV-led and other community organizations are strengthened and actively engaged for 
improved health outcomes. 

 

Expected Outcomes to be achieved: 

● PLHIV-led / community organizations / Traditional Health Practitioners are engaged in HIV 
support services, including treatment literacy and social support for treatment retention 
● PLHIV-led / community organizations / Traditional Health Practitioners achieve allocated 
program targets 
● Increased number of clients referred to Department of Social Development through PLHIV-
led / community organizations 


 

Greater involvement of PLHIV-led and other community-level institutions in Limpopo Province is 
critical to ensuring equitable access to HIV services and to health services more broadly. As more 
PLHIV access and live on lifelong ART, the engagement of communities of PLHIV is essential for 
treatment retention advocacy, social and political accountability, resource mobilization and social and 
human rights protection. 

 

The Activity will work with PLHIV-led, other community-based organizations, Traditional Health 
Practitioners, and other community institutions, through existing and new forums, to reduce barriers 
to HIV/TB services and improve treatment outcomes with a specific focus on retention in care and 
treatment. Technical support may include training and skills building to provide community adherence 
counseling and even assist with the facilitation of community-based multi-month dispensing. 

 

IR3.2 Private sector engaged to improve health outcomes 

 

Expected Outcomes to be achieved: 

● Opportunities for program-enhancing partnerships with private sector identified and 
facilitated to 1) address social determinants of health; 2) strengthen the health system; and/or 
3) improve health outcomes 


 

The Activity aims to support the creation of partnerships with a range of private sector actors with the 
capacity to contribute to addressing factors affecting client health-seeking behavior in Limpopo 
Province and/or factors impeding on the health system. The private sector can augment health care 
services in one of two ways– either by providing services directly, or enhancing services that already 
exist: 

 

● Service provision: Private sector partners provide health services that either add to existing 
health offerings or fill gaps where they exist. This is often a good model when private sector 
health offerings can provide more cost-effective and/or higher-quality service delivery than 



what currently exists, particularly where they can help access populations that would otherwise 
not receive care. 
● Service enhancement: Private sector partners leverage their employee base, supply chains, 
professional networks, and/or provide technical advisory, or financing to enhance the quality, 
reach, or efficiency of existing health services and government/donor investments. This can 
include implementing market-based innovations or approaches; leveraging networks; 
innovative financing for projects; technical assistance, capacity development; and workplace 
health initiatives. 


 

Private sector partnerships can address many components of health challenges typically seen in clinics. 
Examples include issues of health facility infrastructure constraints, food insecurity, insufficient 
transportation, mental health of both health care workers and patients, lack of electricity, and limited 
access to broadband. Resolving these, or other challenges, with private sector partnerships would serve 
to address social determinants of health and barriers to optimal client outcomes. 

 

C. GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS 

 

The geographic target area of the Activity is the Limpopo Province with tailored and targeted 
interventions and technical support at the Provincial level and the district level. The districts may 
change in alignment with USAID, PEPFAR and/or GoSA direction. 

D. SUSTAINABILITY 

 

A key objective of USAID development assistance to South Africa is to support sustainable health 
systems and health care services by reinforcing systems at all levels. USAID intends that its funding 
will consolidate and build upon existing activities to improve the health of all populations. As 
geographies become nearer to achieving epidemic control and sustained viral suppression, there will 
be a shift from an emergency response to one aligned to supporting institutionalized chronic care 
service delivery models. This next phase requires a concerted shift of existing approaches to realize 
efficiencies through a robust sustainability plan with key milestones from the outset of the Activity 
until its conclusion. PEPFAR defines sustainability as the development of technical competence, 
human capacity, and management systems. 

 

USAID aims to increase the delivery of services and technical assistance through partnerships with 
local organizations - both governments and non-governmental/private sectors - and to eventually 
transition programs to national, provincial and district financing, planning and management processes. 

 

USAID’s Bureau for Global Health Office of HIV/AIDS developed USAID’s Approach to HIV and 
Optimized Programing (AHOP) through an intensive consultation process with HIV and Global health 
leaders, comprising civil society representatives, host government partners, multilateral organizations, 
and leadership across sectors. 


The AHOP is strategically aligned with the draft PEPFAR Strategy: Vision 2025, UNAIDS Global 
AIDS Strategy, and draft Global Fund Strategy: Fighting Pandemics and Building a Healthier and 
More Equitable World (2023-2030), and with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Goal 3 
target of ending the global AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030 (and uniquely ties other 
SDGs with USAID’s extensive development assets). The AHOP provides five critical pathways for 
an efficacious and durable HIV response that can also be leveraged to tackle other pressing and 
emerging global health challenges. The five critical pathways are: 

 

1) Simplified Service Delivery Models for a Comprehensive Health Response 

2) Adolescent and Youth Health and Resilience 

3) Locally led and Managed HIV Response 

4) Client-centered Supply Chain Solutions 

5) Pandemic Readiness, Response, and Resilience to Future Shocks 

 

The Activity will incorporate the AHOP’s five critical pathways into the program description to 
support achievement of objectives and IRs. 

E. GENDER CONSIDERATIONS 

 

The USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy advances equality between 
women and men, boys, and girls, and empowers women and girls to participate fully in and benefit 
from development activities, through the integration of gender in the entire Activity 
implementation cycle from design and implementation to monitoring and evaluation. 

 

Interventions and technical assistance supported through this Activity will implement a program 
model that addresses structural barriers fueled by gender inequities that impede access to and 
uptake of HIV and TB service delivery in order to reduce gender disparities in the access of HIV 
and TB diagnosis, treatment, and prevention services. The Activity will use evidence-based 
interventions informed by gender analyses that explore the underlying reasons for gender-based 
differences throughout the entire patient pathway. The Activity will integrate gender 
transformative and trauma-informed approaches throughout the program that promote early care 
seeking behavior, and access to HIV and TB services equitably between men and women. The 
Activity will integrate age-appropriate GBV case identification, first-line support, and clinical 
and non-clinical care into HIV service delivery platforms aligned with PEPFAR and WHO 
Guidance. Furthermore, interventions will also uphold the right of all individuals - men, women, 
and transgender people to quality HIV and TB services. While the Activity, under Objective 1, 
specifically IR 1.4 focuses on addressing GBV, it is encouraged to ensure that these gender 
considerations are integrated within all technical interventions and technical assistance under 
each Objective and respective IRs. The Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) plan for the 
Activity should include clearly defined indicators and targets to support measurement of 
performance specific to gender considerations. 

 

 

 


F. MONITORING, COLLABORATING, LEARNING & ADAPTING 

 

Collaborating, Learning and Adapting (CLA) is a central focus of the Activity. The Activity 
contributes to USG’s commitment to a multifaceted CLA approach to development that is rooted in 
the idea that public health interventions yield more effective results if they are evidence based, 
coordinated and collaborative. The Recipient is expected to generate useful real-time data. The 
Recipient is expected to closely collaborate with key in-country stakeholders, including government, 
civil society and other donors to share data from the Activity’s results, implementation research, 
evaluations, assessments and lessons learned from implementation. The Recipient must ensure that 
sufficient effort is invested to monitor activities, collect, analyze, and synthesize data, and to 
publish/share the data as broadly as appropriate. 

 

Consistent with the latest USG guidance, the Recipient will apply a data-driven approach to achieve 
results, while ensuring efficiency in the use of USG funding. Central to this approach is using data to 
more precisely target resources and tailor interventions and technical support in the Activity’s 
geographic target area based on the burden of disease and need. Continuous learning and adaptation 
of interventions according to changes in the epidemiology are required throughout the life of the 
Activity. 

 

MONITORING, EVALUATION AND LEARNING (MEL) PLAN 

The Activity will have a rigorous performance monitoring and results reporting system, including 
adequate staffing to monitor performance and measure quantifiable results that demonstrate the 
achievement of the Activity goal, objectives and results. This includes establishing and supporting 
GoSA information systems for routine data collection and analytics and developing a comprehensive 
set of input, output and outcome indicators to adequately measure performance towards achieving set 
periodic targets (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual and end of Activity targets). Data will 
be used to evaluate performance, drive decisions, and guide course corrections as needed. The 
Recipient will be responsible for all aspects of data collection, analysis, and performance reporting 
per USAID’s monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual results reporting cycles. 

The Activity is largely funded by PEPFAR funding, and therefore required PEPFAR indicators will 
be included in the monitoring, evaluation and learning plan (MEL) and used to measure and report on 
performance. An updated and comprehensive list of the indicators used by PEPFAR globally as well 
as the PEPFAR reporting process will be provided upon award. PEPFAR indicators may also be found 
in the PEPFAR Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Indicator Reference Guide located on the 
www.PEPFAR.gov website under PEPFAR reports. Those Objectives and IRs requiring the use and 
reporting of PEPFAR Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (MER) indicators are listed in the table 
below. PEPFAR MER indicators are routinely reviewed and may change throughout each year of the 
Activity based on the evolving epidemiology of HIV and TB and other closely related health issues in 
the Limpopo Province. 

 

Upon award, the Recipient’s MEL plan will be finalized in consultation with USAID to finalize 
indicators and performance targets for the first year of the Activity. 


The Activity MEL Plan must: 

 

● Include the following key elements: Theory of change, logic model, performance 
monitoring, beneficiaries feedback plan, evaluation plan, CLA approach, roles and 
responsibilities, schedule of MEL plan tasks (including planned assessments such as any 
routine supervision and monitoring visits, along with any data quality assessments that are 
planned for the upcoming implementation year) and schedule of reporting to USAID. 
● Benchmark implementation using existing program data at site, regional and, if applicable, 
national levels. This should assist in the development of quality improvement and quality 
assurance processes at site, regional and national levels. 
● If applicable, include required PEPFAR MER indicators specific to the Activity. Final 
required MER indicators will be finalized at the time of the award. 


 

● Include additional indicators that support measuring performance towards achieving 
expected outcomes under each objective and respective IRs, to include indicators to 
measure performance specific to addressing gender inequities and disparities and 
sustainability. 


 

● Periodic targets (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, end of Activity targets, 
as applicable) for each indicator. 


 

● Participate in quarterly activity reviews. This feeds into the PEPFAR Oversight 
Accountability Response Team (POART) and Country Operation Plan (COP) processes. 


 

● Conduct data quality assessments for a subset of key indicators, including, but not limited 
to the treatment cascade (e.g., MER indicators). 


G. MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING APPROACH INCLUDING KEY PERSONNEL 

 

Management and Staffing Approach 

It is envisioned that the Activity will be managed with a comprehensive management approach that 
includes joint oversight, partnership, and management of the Activity with the respective GoSA 
counterparts (e.g., DoH, DSD, DBE where applicable, civil society, district, and local AIDS Councils). 
This may include joint annual planning and joint quarterly program reviews whereby resources and 
performance are reviewed for the previous quarter and programming is mutually designed and agreed 
to for the next quarter. 

 

In addition, it is envisioned that the Activity will be implemented through an appropriate mix of direct 
implementation, technical support, and sub-awards to locally led organizations with expert knowledge 
for the achievement of specific objectives or IRs. 

 

The Applicant should propose an appropriate mix of staff and requisite levels of professional expertise 


to implement the Activity and must identify, recruit, hire, and support appropriate personnel. The 
Applicant must have a combination of core staff to efficiently and cost effectively manage 
implementation and achieve results. 

 

Professional-level skills and management practices are required in the performance of the resulting 
Cooperative Agreement. Accordingly, the Applicant must establish an effective quality control 
program to assure that deliverables and other products meet professional standards and comply with 
requirements. The Applicant must maintain an office in South Africa and have an organizational 
structure that adequately meets management needs to implement. 

 

Things to take into consideration in staffing (for key personnel and all other staff) include gender 
equality and social inclusion, an equitable balance in staffing and staff requirements; personnel 
systems, hiring, and management; and capacity development principles and approaches. When 
qualified personnel are available, the Applicant is encouraged to utilize local personnel with 
appropriate prior experience and expertise. The Applicant is strongly encouraged to consult with 
respective GoSA counterparts per geography for Activity personnel planning, recruitment, and 
placement. 

 

Key Personnel 

The Activity has five (5) key personnel positions which are essential to achieving strategic and 
program objectives. The key personnel must have an appropriate configuration of skills, experience 
and expertise that gives confidence for results achievement. In addition to the Chief of Party position 
described below, the Applicant should propose the appropriate roles of the remaining key personnel 
and their primary responsibilities for managing and leading an effective Activity. All key personnel 
should provide 100% LOE to the project. The following skills and expertise should be largely found, 
collectively, within the Key Personnel: 

 

● Experience in leading public health projects 
● Experience in managing and/or leading local or international donor funded projects 
● Experience in managing large budgets exceeding $10 million per annum 
● Demonstrated ability to develop and manage relationships with a wide range of stakeholders 
including NGO partners and Government Institutions of South Africa at all levels 
● Understanding of the South Africa health care delivery system 


 

It is the Applicant’s discretion to designate positions of Key Personnel on the basis of their staffing 
structure. 

 

Chief of Party - 100% Level of Effort (LOE) 

The Chief of Party (COP) will be responsible for leading a high-quality, results-oriented activity to 
achieve the objectives and expected results. S/he will provide overall strategic and managerial 
leadership of the activity in collaboration with all major stakeholders. S/he will bring a strong 
perspective, vision, and strategy on achieving the goal and objectives of the Activity. The COP’s 
responsibilities must include the overall planning, technical leadership and coordination of all 
activities including the work of any sub-partners. S/he will oversee staff and sub-partners to ensure

propose a rate and explain how the applicant determined the rate. In this case, the Budget 
Narrative must include a detailed breakdown comprised of all items of fringe benefits (e.g., 
superannuation, gratuity, etc.) and the costs of each, expressed in U.S. dollars and as a 
percentage of salaries. 


 

3) Travel and Transportation – Provide details to explain the purpose of the trips, the number 
of trips, the origin and destination, the number of individuals traveling, and the duration of the 
trips. Per Diem and associated travel costs must be based on the applicant’s normal travel 
policies. When appropriate please provide supporting documentation as an attachment, such as 
company travel policy, and explain assumptions in the Budget Narrative. 


 

4) Procurement or Rental of Goods (Equipment & Supplies), Services, and Real Property – 
Must include information on estimated types of equipment, models, supplies and the cost per 
unit and quantity. The Budget Narrative must include the purpose of the equipment and supplies 
and the basis for the estimates. The Budget Narrative must support the necessity of any rental 
costs and reasonableness in light of such factors as: rental costs of comparable property, if any; 



market conditions in the area; alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, 
and value of the property leased. 


 

5) Subawards – Specify the budget for the portion of the program to be passed through to any 
subrecipients. See 2 CFR 200 for assistance in determining whether the sub-tier entity is a 
subrecipient or contractor. The subrecipient budgets must align with the same requirements as 
the applicant’s budget, including those related to fringe and indirect costs. 


 

6) Construction – Not applicable 


 

7) Other Direct Costs – This may include other costs not elsewhere specified, such as report 
preparation costs, passports and visas fees, medical exams, and inoculations, as well as any 
other miscellaneous costs which directly benefit the program proposed by the applicant. The 
applicant should indicate the subject, venue and duration of any proposed conferences and 
seminars, and their relationship to the objectives of the program, along with estimates of costs. 
Otherwise, the narrative should be minimal. 


 

8) Indirect Costs – Applicants must indicate whether they are proposing indirect costs or will 
charge all costs directly. In order to better understand indirect costs please see Subpart E of 2 
CFR 200. The application must identify which approach they are requesting and provide the 
applicable supporting information. Below are the most commonly used Indirect Cost Rate 
methods: 


 

Method 1 - Direct Charge Only 

Eligibility: Any applicant 

Initial Application Requirements: See above on direct costs. 

 

Method 2 - Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) 

Eligibility: Any applicant with a NICRA issued by a USG Agency must use that NICRA 

Initial Application Requirements: If the applicant has a current NICRA, submit your approved 
NICRA and the associated disclosed practices. If your NICRA was issued by an Agency other 
than USAID, provide the contact information for the approving Agency. Additionally, at the 
Agency’s discretion, a provisional rate may be set forth in the award subject to audit and 
finalization. See USAID’s Indirect Cost Rate Guide for Non Profit Organizations for further 
guidance. 

 

Method 3 - De minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) 

Eligibility: Any applicant that does not have a current NICRA 

Initial Application Requirements: Costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct 
costs but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this 
methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as a 
non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate an indirect rate, which the non-Federal entity may apply 
to do at any time. The applicant must describe which cost elements it charges indirectly vs. 
directly. See 2 CFR 200 for further information. 


 

If the applicant does not have an approved NICRA and does not elect to utilize the 10% de 
minimis rate, the Agreement Officer will provide further instructions and may request 
additional supporting information, including financial statements and audits, should the 
application still be under consideration after the merit review. USAID is under no obligation to 
approve the applicant’s requested method. 

 

Cost Sharing – USAID has established a minimum required cost share of ten percent (10%) of 
the Award’s projected value for the recipient of the award. The Applicant must propose cost 
share resources to fulfill or exceed this requirement and estimate the amount of cost-sharing to 
be mobilized over the life of the agreement, as well as specify the sources of such resources, 
and the basis of calculation in the budget narrative. USAID will make the final determination 
and assess whether or not the Applicant's cost share contributions (e.g., categories or items) 
meet the standards set in 2 CFR 200 (US Organizations) or Cost Share Standard Provision (Non-
US Organizations). 

 

Other Supporting Documentation - If the Applicant has established a consortium or legal 
relationship among its partners, the Cost/Business application must include a copy of the legal 
relationship between the parties. 

 

In the case of an application where the entity receiving the award is a joint venture, partnership 
or some other type of group where the proposed applicant is not a legal entity, the Cost/Business 
Application must include a copy of the legal relationship between the prime applicant and its 
partners. The application document should include a full discussion of the relationship between 
the applicant and its partners, including identification of the applicant with which USAID will 
directly engage for purposes of Agreement administration, the identity of the applicant which 
will have accounting responsibility, how Agreement effort will be allocated and the express 
Agreement of the principals thereof to be held jointly and severally liable for the acts or 
omissions of the other. 

 

The cost/business application must include letters of commitments from proposed partners 
which state that the organization is committed to implementing the activities for which it is 
being proposed and the proposed costs have been discussed. 

 

The Applicant must submit a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) if the 
organization has such an agreement with an agency or department of the U.S. Government. If 
the organization does not have a current NICRA, the Applicant may be requested to submit the 
following: 

 

Reviewed Financial Statements Report: a report issued by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) 
documenting the review of the financial statements was performed in accordance with 
Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services; that management is responsible 
for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
applicable financial reporting framework and for designing, implementing and maintaining 


internal control relevant to the preparation. In addition, the applicant must state that the 
organization/firm is not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial 
statements; or 

 

Audited Financial Statements Report: An auditor issues a report documenting the audit was 
conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), the financial 
statements are the responsibility of management, provides an opinion that the financial 
statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the company and the 
results of operations are in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework (or 
issues a qualified opinion if the financial statements are not in conformity with the applicable 
financial reporting framework. 

 

D.6 Prior Approvals in accordance with 2 CFR 200.407 

 

Inclusion of an item of cost in the detailed application budget does not satisfy any requirements for 
prior approval by the Agency. If the applicant would like the award to reflect approval of any cost 
elements for which prior written approval is specifically required for allowability, the applicant must 
specify and justify that cost. See 2 CFR 200.407 for information regarding which cost elements 
require prior written approval. 

 

D.7 Approval of Subawards 

 

The applicant must submit information for all subawards that it wishes to have approved at the time 
of award. For each proposed subaward the applicant must provide the following: 

 

● Name of organization 
● UEI Number 
● Confirmation that the subrecipient does not appear on the Treasury Department’s Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list 
● Confirmation that the subrecipient does not have active exclusions in the System for Award 
Management (SAM) 
● Confirmation that the subrecipient is not listed in the United Nations Security designation 
list 
● Confirmation that the subrecipient is not suspended or debarred 
● Confirmation that the applicant has completed a risk assessment of the subrecipient, in 
accordance with 2 CFR 200.332(b) 
● Any negative findings as a result of the risk assessment and the applicant’s plan for 
mitigation. 


 

D.8 Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and SAM Requirements 

 

USAID may not award to an applicant unless the applicant has complied with all applicable unique 
entity identifier and System for Award Management (SAM) requirements. Each applicant (unless the 
applicant is an individual or Federal awarding agency that is exempted from requirements under 2 


CFR 25.110(b) or (c), or has an exception approved by the Federal awarding agency under 2 CFR 
25.110(d)) is required to: 

 

1. Provide a valid UEI number for the applicant and all proposed sub-recipients; 
2. Be registered in SAM before submitting its application. SAM is streamlining processes, 
eliminating the need to enter the same data multiple times, and consolidating hosting to make the 
process of doing business with the government more efficient (www.sam.gov). 
3. Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which 
it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a federal awarding 
agency. 


 

The registration process may take many weeks to complete. Therefore, applicants are encouraged to 
begin the process early. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements above by the time 
USAID is ready to make an award, USAID may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive 
an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant. 

 

SAM registration: http://www.sam.gov 

 

Non-U.S. applicants can find additional resources for registering in SAM, including a Quick Start 
Guide and a video on how to obtain an NCAGE code, on www.sam.gov, navigate to Help, then to 
International Registrants. 

 

Additional information on working with USAID can be found on: https://www.usaid.gov/work-
usaid. 

 

D.9 History of Performance 

 

USAID reserves the right to obtain relevant information concerning an applicant’s history of 
performance from any sources and may consider such information in its review of the applicant’s risk. 
The Agency may request additional information and conduct a pre-award survey if it determines that 
it is necessary to inform the risk assessment. 

 

The AO will perform a risk assessment (2 CFR 200.206) and may determine that a pre-award survey 
is required to inform the risk assessment in determining whether the prospective recipient has the 
necessary organizational, experience, accounting and operational controls, financial resources, and 
technical skills – or ability to obtain them – in order to achieve the objectives of the program and 
comply with the terms and conditions of the award. Depending on the result of the risk assessment, 
the AO will decide to execute the award, not execute the award, or award with “specific conditions” 
(2 CFR 200.208). 

 

D.10 Branding Strategy and Marking Plan 

 

D.10.1 Branding and Marking 

The Recipient must develop a Branding Strategy and Marking Plan (BMP) following the 


branding guidelines as articulated in Automated Directive System Chapter 320 (ADS 320) to 
ensure the program and publicity materials clearly communicate that assistance from the U.S. 
Government is made possible by the generous support of the American people. The Successful 
Recipient must agree to follow the Branding and Marking Policies established for assistance 
awards under ADS Chapter 320. 

 

It is a federal statutory and regulatory requirement (see Section 641, Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended, and 2 CFR 700.16) that all USAID programs, projects, activities, public 
communications, and commodities that USAID partially or fully funds under a USAID grant or 
cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward must be marked appropriately 
overseas with the USAID identity. In addition, the successful applicant(s) will be required to 
comply with USAID and PEPFAR policy on marking and branding. 

 

USAID will request and evaluate a BMP from the apparently successful Applicant(s), except in 
cases where an existing waiver applies; this evaluation will not be part of the competitive 
evaluation set forth in this section. The successful applicant’s proposed BMP may include a 
request for approval of one or more exceptions to marking requirements. The exceptions must 
align with ADS 320 requirements for exceptions. The Agreement Officer is responsible for 
evaluating and approving the Branding Strategy and a Marking Plan (including any request for 
exceptions) of the apparently successful applicant(s), consistent with the provisions ``Branding 
Strategy,” and USAID and PEPFAR policy on branding and marking, in consultation with a 
Development Outreach and Communications specialist. Please note that in contrast to 
“exceptions' ' to marking requirements, waivers based on circumstances in the host country must 
be approved by Mission Directors or other USAID Principal Officers. 

 

NGO applicants are required to comply with 2 CFR 700.16 and USAID Automated Directive 
System (ADS) Chapter 320, Branding and Marking available at 
https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/320.pdf. 

 

No award will be made without an USAID approved Branding Strategy and Marking Plan.

D.11 CONSCIENCE CLAUSE IMPLEMENTATION (ASSISTANCE) – PRE-AWARD Term 
(February 2012) 

 

(a) An organization, including a faith-based organization, that is otherwise eligible to receive funds 
under this agreement for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, or care— 

1) Shall not be required, as a condition of receiving such assistance 

 

(i) to endorse or utilize a multisectoral or comprehensive approach to combating HIV/AIDS; or 

 

(ii) to endorse, utilize, make a referral to, become integrated with, or otherwise participate in any 
program or activity to which the organization has a religious or moral objection; and 

 

2) Shall not be discriminated against in the solicitation or issuance of grants, contracts, or cooperative 
agreements for refusing to meet any requirement described in paragraph 

 

(a)(1) above. 

(b) An applicant who believes that this solicitation contains provisions or requirements that 
would require it to endorse or use an approach or participate in an activity to which it has a 
religious or moral objection must so notify the cognizant Agreement Officer in accordance 
with the Mandatory Standard Provision titled “Notices” as soon as possible, and in any event 
not later than 15 calendar days before the deadline for submission of applications under this 
solicitation. The applicant must advise which activity(ies) it could not implement and the 
nature of the religious or moral objection. 

 

(c) In responding to the solicitation, an applicant with a religious or moral objection may 
compete for any funding opportunity as a prime partner, or as a leader or member of a 
consortium that comes together to compete for an award. 

 

Alternatively, such applicant may limit its application to those activities it can undertake and 
must indicate in its submission the activity(ies) it has excluded based on religious or moral 
objection. The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated based on the activities for which a proposal 
is submitted and will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably due to the absence of a proposal 
addressing the activity(ies) to which it objected and which it thus omitted. In addition to the 
notification in paragraph 

 

(b) above, the applicant must meet the submission date provided for in the solicitation.

D.12 CONFLICT OF INTEREST PRE-AWARD TERM (August 2018) 

 

a. Personal Conflict of Interest 

1. An actual or appearance of a conflict of interest exists when an applicant organization or an 
employee of the organization has a relationship with an Agency official involved in the competitive 


award decision-making process that could affect that Agency official’s impartiality. The term “conflict 
of interest” includes situations in which financial or other personal considerations may compromise, 
or have the appearance of compromising, the obligations and duties of a USAID employee or recipient 
employee. 

 

2. The applicant must provide conflict of interest disclosures when it submits an SF-424. Should the 
applicant discover a previously undisclosed conflict of interest after submitting the application, the 
applicant must disclose the conflict of interest to the AO no later than ten (10) calendar days following 
discovery. 

 

b. Organizational Conflict of Interest 

The applicant must notify USAID of any actual or potential conflict of interest that they are aware of 
that may provide the applicant with an unfair competitive advantage in competing for this financial 
assistance award. Examples of an unfair competitive advantage include but are not limited to situations 
in which an applicant or the applicant’s employee gained access to non-public information regarding 
a federal assistance funding opportunity, or an applicant or applicant’s employee was substantially 
involved in the preparation of a federal assistance funding opportunity. USAID will promptly take 
appropriate action upon receiving any such notification from the applicant. 

 

(END OF PRE-AWARD TERM)

THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE LEFT BLANK INTENTIONALLY. 

 


SECTION E: APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION 

 

USAID intends to award a single Cooperative Agreement from this Notice of Funding Opportunity 
(NOFO). However, USAID reserves the right to make more than one award or no award if determined 
to be in the best interest of the Government. Each application submitted compliant with the terms of 
this NOFO will be reviewed according to the process set forth below. USAID/South Africa intends to 
evaluate the applications and award an agreement without discussions with the Applicants. However, 
USAID reserves the right to conduct discussions if the latter is determined by the Agreement Officer 
to be necessary. Therefore, the initial application will contain the applicant’s best terms from a 
Technical and Cost/Price standpoint. 

The Technical Application will be reviewed according to the following merit review criteria 

 

E.1 MERIT REVIEW CRITERIA 

 

The merit review criteria presented below have been tailored to the requirements of this particular 
NOFO. Applicants should note that these criteria serve to: 

(a) identify the significant matters which applicants should address in their applications; and 

(b) set the standard against which all applications shall be evaluated. 

To facilitate the review of application, the applicant must organize its application per the guidance 
provided under Section D Application and Submission Information of the NOFO. 

The criteria set forth below will be used by the Technical Review Committee to evaluate all 
applications submitted in response to this NOFO. The criteria are listed in descending order of 
importance: 

 

 

Merit Review Criteria 

1. Technical Approach 


2. Management and Staffing Approach 


3. Sustainability and Partnerships 




 

 


E.2 REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS 

 

As per ADS 303.3.6.3(a), USAID will appoint a Selection Committee (SC) to review the application 
using the review criteria under NOFO Sections E.3 below. Further, per ADS 303.3.6.3(b), the 
appointed “committee members possess the requisite technical knowledge or expertise to review the 
programmatic merits of the applications.” 

Prior to negotiating an actual award, the Agreement Officer will review the apparently successful 
applicant’s budget to ensure that costs, including cost sharing (if applicable), are in compliance with 
USAID’s policies. The costs proposed must be determined to be reasonable, based on the Cost 
Application and other information before award can be made. 

Award will be made to the responsible applicant whose application is determined to be the best based 
on technical and cost factors specified in this NOFO. The Agreement Officer must also evaluate the 
risk of the apparently successful applicant and is charged with the final determination of whether to 
make an award to the apparently successful applicant. 

Authority to obligate the Government: The Agreement Officer is the only individual who may legally 
commit the U.S. Government to the expenditure of public funds. No costs chargeable to the proposed 
Agreement may be incurred before receipt of either an Agreement signed by the Agreement Officer 
or a specific, written authorization from the Agreement Officer. 

 

E.3 APPLICATION MERIT REVIEW 

 

As per 303.3.6.3, USAID will conduct a merit review of the application submitted in response to this 
NOFO. 

Applications will be evaluated using an adjectival evaluation scale (exceptional, very good, 
satisfactory, marginal, and unsatisfactory) as described in table below. 

Ratings 

Exceptional 

An Exceptional application has the following characteristics: 

● A comprehensive and thorough application of exceptional 
merit 
● Application meets and fully exceeds the Government 
expectations or exceeds NOFO purpose and presents very 
low risk or no overall degree of risk of unsuccessful 
performance. 
● Strengths significantly outweigh any weaknesses that may 
exist. 


Very Good 

A Very Good application has the following characteristics: 

● Demonstrates a strong grasp of the objectives. 
● Application meets NOFO purpose and presents a moderate 





overall degree of risk of unsuccessful project performance. 
● Strengths significantly outweigh any weaknesses that may 
exist. 


Satisfactory 

A Satisfactory application has the following characteristics: 

● An application demonstrating a reasonably sound response 
and a good grasp of the objectives. 
● Application meets the NOFO purpose and presents a 
moderate overall degree of risk of unsuccessful project 
performance. 
● Strengths outweigh weaknesses. 


Marginal 

A Marginal application has the following characteristics: 

● The applications show a limited understanding of the 
objectives. 
● Application meets some of more of the NOFO purpose but 
presents a significant overall degree of risk of unsuccessful 
project performance. 
● Weaknesses equal or outweigh any strength that exists. 


Unsatisfactory 

An Unsatisfactory application has the following characteristics: 

● The application does not meet the NOFO purpose or requires 
a major rewrite of the application. 
● Presents an unacceptable degree of risk of unsuccessful 
project performance. 
● Weaknesses demonstrate a lack of understanding of the 
Government’s needs. 
● Weaknesses significantly outweigh any strength that exists. 




 

The criteria set forth below will be used by the technical review committee to evaluate all applications 
submitted in response to this NOFO. The criteria are listed in descending order of importance: 

 

1. Technical Approach 


 

2. Management and Staffing Approach 


 

3. Sustainability and Partnerships 


 


E.3.1 CRITERIA 1 – TECHNICAL APPROACH 

USAID will evaluate the extent to which the proposed technical approach, the draft work plan, and 
MEL plan demonstrate interventions and tasks that will achieve the stated outcomes and objectives in 
Section A. 

E.3.2 CRITERIA 2 – MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING APPROACH 

The Applicant will be evaluated on the quality of the management plan, how well the appropriateness 
of the staffing and management approach (including the key personnel and organizational chart) will 
support successful implementation of the Activity in the Limpopo province. 

E.3.3 CRITERIA 3 – SUSTAINABILITY AND PARTNERSHIPS 

 

The applicant will be evaluated on the extent to which: the application addresses the requirements 
listed in the NOFO, the sustainability and partnerships approach will support successful 
implementation of the Activity, the viability of the sustainability plan to establish lasting partnerships 
which will continue to support the Activity efforts in the Limpopo province once the activity has 
formally ended. 

 

E.3.4 BUSINESS (COST) REVIEW 

The Agency will evaluate the cost application of the Applicant(s) under consideration for an award as 
a result of the merit criteria review to determine whether the costs are allowable in accordance with 
the cost principles found in 2 CFR 200 Subpart E. 

 

While cost is not weighted, the cost application of the apparently successful technical application will 
be evaluated for cost effectiveness. It will be reviewed to determine based on fairness, cost realism, 
completeness, and reasonableness whether they are fair, allowable, allocable, and realistic for the 
proposed technical application. Other considerations are the completeness of the application, adequacy 
of budget detail and consistency with elements of the technical application. In addition, the 
organization must demonstrate adequate financial management capability, to be measured for a 
responsibility determination. 

The Agency will also consider (1) the extent of the Applicant's understanding of the financial aspects 
of the program and the Applicant's ability to perform the activities within the amount requested; (2) 
whether the Applicant's plans will achieve the Activity objectives with reasonable economy and 
efficiency; and (3) whether any special conditions relating to costs should be included in the award. 
USAID reserves the right to determine the resulting level of funding selected for award. Cost 
evaluation will ONLY be conducted for the apparently successful applicant(s). 

 

Proposed cost share will be reviewed for compliance with the standards set forth in 2 CFR 200.306, 2 
CFR 700.10, and the Standard Provision "Cost Share" for non-U.S. entities. 

The AO will perform a risk assessment (2 CFR 200.206). The AO may determine that a pre-award 
survey is required to support the risk assessment in determining whether the prospective recipient has 


the necessary organizational, experience, accounting and operational controls, financial resources, and 
technical skills – or ability to obtain them – in order to achieve the objectives of the program and 
comply with the terms and conditions of the award. Depending on the result of the risk assessment, 
the AO will decide to execute the award, not execute the award, or award with “specific conditions” 
(2 CFR 200.208).

F.3.3. Annual Work Plan, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Plan and 
Performance Indicators 

 

F.3.3.1. Annual Work Plan 

USAID will provide a specific format for the Annual Work Plan. The Annual Work 
Plan will detail the interventions and technical support to be completed during the 
upcoming annual performance period and will include Activity Location Data in a 
format prescribed by USAID. 

The first year Work Plan which is requested to be submitted with the Technical 
Application should include the 60-day mobilization plan which details tasks related to 
mobilizing program management and operations (i.e., establishing headquarters, hiring 
of staff, and operationalizing service delivery systems and service delivery partners (as 
required) under the award). 

 

F.3.3.2. Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Plan and Performance 
Indicators 

The Recipient will establish a rigorous performance monitoring and results reporting 
system to monitor performance and measure quantifiable results demonstrating the 
achievement of the Activity results and expected outcomes. This includes establishing 


information systems for routine data collection and analytics and developing a 
comprehensive set of input, output, and outcome indicators to adequately measure 
performance. 

The Recipient will be responsible for all aspects of data collection, analysis, and 
performance reporting per USAID’s quarterly and annual results reporting cycles. The 
Recipient will be expected to conduct routine data quality assessments in collaboration 
with USAID and take corrective actions as needed to improve data quality. Data will 
be used to evaluate performance, drive decisions, guide course corrections as needed, 
and determine future funding. 

A template for the MEL Plan will be provided by the AOR. 

If PEPFAR indicators are to be used due to the Activity being funded wholly or 
partially by PEPFAR funding, PEPFAR indicators will be included in the MEL and 
used to measure and report on performance. In addition, non-PEPFAR indicators will 
be used to measure performance against each Intermediate Result. A complete list of 
the indicators used by PEPFAR will be provided. PEPFAR indicators can also be found 
in PEPFAR’s Monitoring Evaluation and Reporting (MER) Indicators Reference 
Guide at www.pepfar.gov. The Recipient will work closely with USAID to finalize 
indicators and set performance targets. Data will be used to evaluate the Recipient’s 
performance, drive decisions, guide course corrections as needed, and determine future 
funding. 

 

F.3.3.3. Quarterly Performance Report 

The Quarterly Performance Report shall be based on the three-month periods: 

 

Quarter 1: October 1-December 31 

Quarter 2: January 1-March 31 

Quarter 3: April 1-June 30 

Note: Quarter 4- July 1-September 30 performance and results will be included in the 
Annual Performance Report. 

The time frame of the first quarterly report and its respective due date will be 
determined by USAID/SA based on the actual contract award date. All subsequent 
reports will adhere to the three-month period time frame as listed above. The report 
format will be provided by USAID/SA upon award of the contract. Quarterly reports 
will include subsections for the province (and by district) and interventions 
implemented and results achieved to date. The quarterly report is meant to be short, to 
the point, but informative, providing a comprehensive summary of the implementation 
of the Activity and results achieved in the prior quarter. Changes to the quarterly report 
format and content may be made throughout the life of the agreement to ensure its 
utility but only with formal approval by the AOR. Each quarterly report will include at 
least three (3) one-page success stories with pictures or best practices. 


In some cases, the quarterly reporting may need to include a separate section and 
process to report on results achieved for a specific area of technical support or 
interventions implemented, such as COVID-19 emergency funding, Global Health 
Security Funding, or other related funding to address specific public health issues of 
immediate concern for USAID. The AOR will provide further reporting instructions in 
these cases. 

 

F.3.3.4. Monthly and quarterly reporting of performance Indicators into 
USAID and PEPFAR systems 

For monthly performance indicators that will be reported into USAID data systems, 
USAID will provide instructions. If PEPFAR indicators are to be reported on, the 
Recipient will report into the PEPFAR electronic data collection system on results 
achieved towards the annual targets of the required PEPFAR indicators. The AOR will 
provide instructions. 

 

F.3.4 Environmental Compliance, Environmental Mitigation Monitoring Plan 
(EMMP) and Environmental Mitigation Monitoring Report (EMMR) 

 

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, Section 117 requires that the impact of 
USAID’s activities on the environment be considered, and that USAID include environmental 
sustainability as a central consideration in designing and carrying out its development programs. 
This mandate is codified in Federal Regulations (22 CFR 216) and in USAID’s Automated 
Directives System (ADS) Parts 201.5.10g and 204 (http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ADS/200/), 
which, in part, require that the potential environmental impacts of USAID-financed activities be 
identified prior to a final decision to proceed and that appropriate environmental safeguards are 
adopted for all activities. Recipient environmental compliance obligations under these regulations 
and procedures are specified in the following paragraphs of this NOFO. 

No activity funded under this Cooperative Agreement will be implemented unless an 
environmental threshold determination, as defined by 22 CFR 216, has been reached for that 
activity, as documented in a Request for Categorical Exclusion (RCE), Initial Environmental 
Examination (IEE), or Environmental Assessment (EA) duly signed by the Bureau Environmental 
Officer (BEO). (Hereinafter, such documents are described as “approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentation.”) 

An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) has been approved for the project funding this RFA 
and for activities to be undertaken herein. The IEE contains a Negative Determination for the 
proposed activities per 22 CFR 216.3(a)(7)(iv). 

Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plans (EMMPs) are required for USAID-funded 
activities when the 22 CFR 216 documentation governing the activity (e.g., the Initial 
Environmental Examination (IEE)) imposes mitigation measures related to an intervention(s) to 
be implemented under the Activity. EMMPs ensure that the USAID ADS 204.3 requirements 
for incorporating and monitoring appropriate mitigative measures into project or activity design. 
The Recipient will prepare an EMMP and submit it with the first annual work plan. Annually, 


thereafter, the Recipient will update the EMMP and submit it with each subsequent annual work 
plan in collaboration with the USAID Cognizant Technical Officer and Mission Environmental 
Officer (MEO), as appropriate, shall review all ongoing and planned activities under the resulting 
cooperative agreement to determine if they are within the scope of the approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentations. A template will be provided by USAID/SA. 

Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Reports (EMMRs) are required for USAID-funded 
activities when the 22 CFR 216 documentation governing the activity impose conditions on at 
least one intervention implemented under the activity. EMMRs ensure that the ADS 204.3.3 
requirements for reporting on environmental compliance are met. The Recipient will complete 
an EMMR annually, submitting it with the annual performance report. A template will be 
provided by USAID. 

 

If the Recipient plans any new activities outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentation, it shall prepare an amendment to the documentation for USAID 
review and approval. No such new activities shall be undertaken prior to receiving written 
USAID approval of environmental documentation amendments. 

 

Any ongoing activities found to be outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 
environmental documentation shall be halted until an amendment to the documentation is 
submitted and written approval is received from USAID. 

 

F.3.5 Annual Performance Report 

 

The Annual Report will be a comprehensive summary of the performance and results achieved 
for the annual reporting period divided by province and district. The AOR will provide a format 
and more details on the content for the annual performance report within three months prior to 
the end of the annual reporting period. 

 

F.3.6 Program Income 

 

If program income is anticipated to be generated under the award, income earned during the 
Activity’s period of performance must be added to the total program amount and used to further 
eligible objectives for the Activity. If program income is applicable under this Activity, it will 
be implemented in accordance with the standard provision RAA16. Program Income (AUGUST 
2020). 

 

F.3.7 Branding Strategy and Marking Plan (BMP) 

 

The Recipient will submit a Branding Strategy and Marking Plan within 30 days of the award. 

 

F.3.8 Annual Report on Non-Expendable Property 

 

The Recipient will provide an Annual Report on Non-Expendable Property on the last working 


day of October in accordance with ADS 303. The report must contain an updated list of 
equipment purchased with USAID funds to include description, quantity, unit price, total price, 
acquisition date, location, and condition of each item. 

 

F.3.9 Disposition of Assets and Closeout Plan 

 

Close-out and disposition plan in accordance with 2 CFR 200.343 and 2 CFR 200.313 will be 
submitted six months before the activity end date for USAID approval. The Disposition of Assets 
and Closeout Plan must include, at a minimum, an illustrative property disposition plan 
addressing all requirements under the award and local law for the transfer of property; a plan for 
the phase out of in-country operations; a delivery schedule for all reports or other deliverables 
required under the award; a timeline for all required audits after closeout of the award; and a 
timeline for completing all required actions in the Disposition of Assets and Closeout Plan. 

 

F.3.10 Final Report 

 

The Final Report must include no less than the following information. The AOR will provide a 
format and more details on the content for the final report six months prior to the end of the 
agreement. 

 

a. Summary of results achieved by geographic target area. 




 

b. Summary of transition of interventions to stakeholders and Government of South 
Africa counterparts to promote sustainability. 




 

F.3.11 Ad Hoc Reports 

 

Ad Hoc Reporting may be required, as necessary during the activity implementation. Specific 
instructions will be shared in the resulting award. 

 

F.4 Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) 

 

The MOU(s) articulates partnership principles and strategic objectives and capitalizes on the 
commonalities between objectives and approaches to establish a basis for ongoing dialogue and 
cooperation between the USAID implementing partner and the GoSA entity (i.e., Provincial 
Department of Health). As identified and as needed, the Recipient will establish an MOU(s) with 
GoSA entities, as agreed upon in collaboration with USAID/SA. The Recipient will not establish an 
MOU(s) without USAID’s involvement and collaboration. 

 

 

 

 


F.5 Development Experience Clearinghouse Requirements 

 

The Recipient must submit reports in accordance with Mandatory Standard Provision M.8 
Submissions to the Development Experience Clearinghouse and Data Rights (JUNE 2012). Specific 
instructions will be shared in the resulting award.

ANNEX A: SOUTH AFRICA NATIONAL CURRENT STATISTICS AND 
EPIDEMIOLOGY 

South Africa is an upper-middle income country, with many cultures, languages, ethnic groups, and 
religions. In 2021, the population was estimated at 59.6 million, of which approximately 51% (30 
million) were female.26 Life expectancy at birth was estimated to be 67.7 years for females (72.7 
without HIV/AIDS) and 61.5 years for males (65.6 without HIV/AIDS).27 The infant mortality rate 
was estimated at 22.1 per 1,000 live births.28

2021, 24(S5):e25788 

South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world, with an estimated nearly 8 million people 
living with HIV (PLHIV).29 Adult (15-49) HIV prevalence is 18.9%; among women aged 15-49, it is 
25.0%.30 While incidence is declining each year, the HIV burden in South Africa continues to grow. 
Nationally, there are approximately 198,311 new HIV infections estimated to occur between mid-2021 
to mid-2022 with women over 15 accounting for 62.7% of all new HIV infections.31 

Of the 95-95-95 targets, South Africa has achieved 94-75-92.32 The second 95–the proportion of 
PLHIV who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART)–remains a critical gap. Just 5.6 million people are 
currently taking ART.33 This gap is evident within the 27 high HIV burden districts currently 
supported by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). While all PEPFAR-
supported districts have achieved over 90% toward the first 95, none have achieved 90% toward the 
second 95.34 As we get closer to HIV epidemic control, South Africa will need to continue to simplify 
services for clients, including decentralized service delivery and multi-month dispensing (MMD) of 
ARVs and other medications. This will allow for more attention and resources to be given to a much 


smaller proportion of clients that may not yet be virally suppressed, and to increase the numbers of 
those on ART. 

“Know your epidemic” and offering differentiated modalities for care remain important guiding 
principles to address gaps in the clinical cascade.35 Linkage to care and viral load suppression are 
particularly challenging for school-aged children and young adults. Men and key populations face 
challenges in accessing care that recognizes their special circumstances and needs. Women aged 25-
49, who comprise 45.1% of PLHIV, also require tailored responses to ensure acceptable options and 
equitable access to care.36

Prevention of HIV infection for all at risk populations will be key to epidemic control in the future. 
Prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) has been very successful in South Africa and 
must be sustained. Biomedical options, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and outreach to 
communities to address HIV risk will remain critical. 

 

Although successes with HIV treatment are extending the lives of PLHIV, South Africa still has a 
large burden of children orphaned due to HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS estimates that 1.6 million children are 
living without one or both parents as a result of the disease.37 These children face multiple and 
compounding risks such as poverty, hunger, and violence, all of which increase vulnerability to HIV 
infection in addition to social, emotional and associated challenges. 

 

TB is another persistent public health challenge in South Africa. The country is one of 30 high-burden 
countries globally, and among the eight countries that contribute nearly 90% of all TB cases 
annually.38 South Africa alone accounts for 3% of global TB cases annually. In fact, South Africa’s 
rate of new TB infections is the highest in the world, after adjusting for population size. South Africa 
is also among the 14 countries with the highest burden of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and TB 
and HIV comorbidity globally.39 Co-infection among people living with HIV in 2019 was measured 
at 59%.40 South Africa’s first National TB Prevalence Survey indicates that TB prevalence (including 


NOFO Nr.: 72067423RFA00004

all TB forms) nationally was 737 per 100,000 in 2018.41Poor living conditions and late presentationto health facilities are key drivers of the TB burden. 

While contending with significant HIV and TB needs locally, South Africacarries the greatest burden 
of COVID-19 in all of Africa, with over 4 million cases and 101,982 deaths (as of 5 August 2022).42Newand emerging acuteinfectious disease outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, threaten South Africa’sprogress in the control of infectious diseases including TB and HIV.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic hashad devastating impactson theeconomy and public finances, with impactsechoing through the health 
sector, underscoring theneed fora strong and resilient health system and global health security.

ANNEX B: USG RESPONSE 

HIV/AIDS Epidemic Control 

HIV is a key focus of all PEPFAR activities. In South Africa, PEPFAR is implemented via USAID, 
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the Peace Corps. PEPFAR activities support South 
Africa in reaching the 95-95-95 targets and place a strong emphasis on programmatic linkages between 
prevention and treatment at both the community and facility level. In 2014, PEPFAR launched the 
DREAMS Initiative – “Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe: 
Preventing HIV in Adolescent Girls and Young Women” – to aggressively target PEPFAR resources 
to reduce new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). In South Africa, 
PEPFAR implements a broad portfolio of activities toward the goal of epidemic control in specific 
geographic target areas. These represent the highest HIV burden districts in South Africa and 
encompass 82 percent of PLHIV in the country. For further information, refer to the most recent 
PEPFAR South Africa South Africa PEPFAR Country Operational Plan. 

 

Elimination of TB 

The USG is a global leader in support of the fight against TB worldwide and in 2016 launched the 
U.S. National Action Plan for Combating Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (NAP), which aims to 
address the domestic and global challenges of MDR-TB. For further information on TB activities in 
South Africa, refer to the most recent USAID TB Road Map for South Africa. 

 

COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Global Health Security 

The USG is also committed to defeating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at home and abroad. In August 
2021, USAID Administrator, Samantha Power, announced new funding via the American Rescue Plan 
to expand and intensify the fight against COVID-19 internationally.43 Further, in December 2021, the 
Administrator announced the U.S. Government’s Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX), 
which will bring additional funding with a focus on vaccination, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.44 A 
significant portion of Global VAX funding has been awarded to South Africa, which aims to achieve 
70% vaccination by the end of 2022. Efforts in this regard, which are led by USAID and involve other 
US government agencies in South Africa, will mitigate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on 
the country’s health and development indicators in the near term while also contributing to greater 
resilience to system-wide shocks in the future.

Most recently, the USG has announced a new USAID Global Health Security strategy that aims to 


prevent, detect and respond to global health pandemics. The new strategy will work with country 
governments and other partners in USG-supported countries to address identified gaps and improve 
capacities in key global health security areas; support and sustain international capacity on surveillance 
and monitoring systems, including syndromic, pathogen, and events-based systems, needed to detect 
and regularly report known and new infectious diseases threats in humans, plants, and animals; support 
partner countries to develop, implement, and scale-up evidence-informed interventions at the 
community level to reduce zoonotic pathogen spillover; and increase demonstrated capacity in 
biosafety and biosecurity. 

 

USAID Southern Africa Health Sector Strategy 

USAID’s health program in South Africa aims to “partner with the GoSA to end the spread of HIV, 
TB, and other infectious diseases, and save lives, while building a health system that is resilient, 
sustainable and equitable.” In line with this mission statement, USAID South Africa’s health program 
has four strategic goals for programming its development assistance. These are provided in Figure 1. 
The Activity described in this notice will be administered by USAID will need to align with its mission 
and goals for work in the country.
